The main difference is\\nthat an anime is considered a Japanese style of cartoons in the West.\\n\\nMany English-language dictionaries\\n[define](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anime) anime as \"a Japanese\\nstyle of motion-picture animation\" or as \"a style of animation developed in\\nJapan.\"\\n\\nHowever, in Japan, the term \"anime\" does not specify an animation\\'s nation of\\norigin or style. Instead, it serves as a blanket term to refer to all forms of\\nanimation from around the world (both foreign and domestic). The word \"anime\"\\nis loan word referring to \"animation\" or \"cartoons,\" adapted from the English\\nword \"animation.\"\\n\\nTaking this from another perspective, in Japan, Disney movies are referred to\\nas \"Disney Anime\", This refers to a certain style, not the genre as a whole.\\n\\nThe Japanese Wikipedia on \"anime\" [specifically\\nnotes](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1#anime) that:\\n\\n>\\n> アニメーションをアニメと略せる言語は日本語に限られるため、日本国外で「anime」という場合は日本製の表現様式のアニメに対して用いられる。日本国内では、製作国や作風に関わりなくアニメが使用される。\\n\\nWhile in Japanese, \"animation\" was abbreviated to \"anime,\" Outside of Japan,\\nthe word has been used only to refer to media considered \"Japanese animation.\"\\nHowever in Japan, the country of origin and literary style (of the media) are\\nnot taken into account when applying \"anime\" to it.\\n\\nWestern cartoons and anime can both vary in drawing styles, based on the\\nstaff, budget, and character/set designs. Anime series are typically more\\ndetailed than your average western show as there is more of an abundance of\\ntechnically skilled artists overseas than there are available in the West.\\n\\nBoth can reach different age regardless of their initial target audience (\\n_Avatar: The Last Airbender_ , _My Little Pony_ , and _Adventure Time_ are\\nnotable examples).\\n\\nTypically western cartoons are more lighthearted when compared to Japanese\\nanime. However, both can deal with more mature themes, in both a serious (like\\n_Cyber 6_ , _Mighty Max_ , and _Dungeons and Dragons_ ) and humorous light\\n(like _Futurama_ , _South Park_ , _The Simpsons_ , and _Family Guy_ ). There\\nare western cartoons for mature adults just like there are 18+ anime in Japan.\\n\\nIf you ask the average person in your country and one in Japan, both will\\nconsider them to be childish.

The key, as we know, is usually required to open the gate though\\nwhich the spirit comes from the spirit world. When the gates are opened in the\\nfirst time, the wizard and the spirit make an agreement (e.g. on which days\\nshould the spirit be summoned).\\n\\nNow, if you look at how do the spirits react when Lucy calls them, you may\\nnotice some interesting things. For example, when she summons Aquarius,\\nAquarius is often disappointed with Lucy, and shortly returns to the spirit\\nword, sometimes refusing to do what Lucy asks for.\\n\\nOne might ask: _why in that case would the spirit even appear_? If Aquarius is\\nnot in the mood, she could as well not appear at all, rather than be summoned\\nand almost instantly go back (after a few insults towards Lucy, that is). That\\nleads us to an assumption that the spirits can not actually refuse to be\\nsummoned, and possessing the key almost equals possessing the spirit's\\ncontract (they just have no other options).\\n\\nSome spirits, however, find benefits in working with the wizards, for example,\\nTaurus enjoys being summoned because that way he can observe Lucy's body,\\nwhich he admires.\\n\\nIn general, most of the spirits become very loyal to Lucy once she acquires\\ntheir keys, so that is another argument for the assumption that possessing the\\nkey forces the spirit to make the contract and work for the wizard.\\n\\n\", parent_id='143'),\n",

When an anime series is based on a\\nmanga that is still in development, the anime is eventually going to reach a\\npoint where it outpaces the manga, because anime episodes tend to be developed\\nquicker than manga volumes. When this happens, either filler for the anime is\\ncreated or changes to the anime\\'s storyline and characters are made so that\\nthe anime can continue to be developed. The latter is what happened to FMA03.\\nFMA03\\'s storyline started to diverge from FMAM\\'s storyline after around 10\\nepisodes because, at that point, the anime was starting to outpace the manga.\\n\\nOn the other hand, FMAB was created when FMAM was nearing the end of its\\ndevelopment. This allowed FMAB\\'s storyline to be more faithful to FMAM\\'s\\nstoryline because FMAB had a mostly-complete storyline to draw from FMAM.\\n\\nThe major differences between FMA03 and FMAB & FMAM are:\\n\\n# Storyline\\n\\n> Although both stories follow Edward and Alphonse, the overarching story is\\n> considerably different between FMA03 and FMAB & FMAM. In FMAB & FMAM the\\n> main antagonist was a character referred to as **Father** , a being of\\n> incredible power who is capable of performing transmutation at will, and\\n> without regard for equivalent exchange. His ultimate goal in FMAB & FMAM is\\n> to steal the power of what he refers to as \"God\" and become a being of\\n> infinite power and knowledge.  \\n>  \\n>  The main antagonist in FMA03 is Dante. Unlike Father, she is just a normal\\n> human being who created a Philosopher\\'s Stone and has managed to live a long\\n> time by transferring her consciousness into the body of other human beings\\n> whenever she was nearing death. Dante\\'s only motivation is to become\\n> immortal and live forever.\\n\\n# The Homunculi\\n\\n> In FMA03, the **Homunculi** were the result of attempting to perform human\\n> transmutation and failing. They could only be killed by destroying their\\n> original body.  \\n>  \\n>  In FMAB & FMAM, the Homunculi were created by Father, with each one\\n> representing a different aspect of his personality ( **Lust** , **Gluttony**\\n> , **Envy** , **Greed** , **Wrath** , **Sloth** , and **Pride** ; the seven\\n> deadly sins). Each Homunculus is also powered by a Philosopher\\'s Stone.\\n> Unlike FMA03\\'s Homunculi, FMAB & FMAM\\'s Homunculi do not have an \"original\"\\n> body that needs to be destroyed. Instead, either the Philosopher\\'s Stone\\n> powering them needs to be destroyed or its power drained (normally through\\n> forcing them to regenerate multiple times).  \\n>  \\n>  Another difference is the identify of the Homunculi themselves, with some\\n> Homunculi from FMAB & FMAM not appearing in FMA03 at all and others having\\n> their name changed.  \\n>  \\n>  **Gluttony** , **Envy** , **Lust** , and **Greed** have the same name and\\n> appearance in FMAB, FMAM, and FMA03.  \\n>  FMAB & FMAM\\'s **Wrath** (King Bradley) is called **Pride** in FMA03.  \\n>  FMAB & FMAM\\'s **Pride** (Selim Bradley) is not present in FMA03.  \\n>  FMA03\\'s **Wrath** is unique to the series. He was the result of Izumi\\n> Curtis\\'s attempt to revive her son.  \\n>  FMAB & FMAM\\'s **Sloth** is not present in FMA03.  \\n>  FMA03\\'s **Sloth** is unique to the series. She was the result of Ed and\\n> Al\\'s attempt to bring back their mother.\\n\\n# Hohenheim\\n\\n> In FMA03, **Hohenheim** is just a normal human being who was originally\\n> Dante\\'s lover; however, he eventually left her due to no longer sharing her\\n> desire to have immortality at any cost. Like Dante, he created a\\n> Philosopher\\'s Stone and gained a long life by transferring his consciousness\\n> into another person\\'s body. His role in the anime is very minor, and he\\n> becomes trapped on the other side of the Gate after a confrontation with\\n> Dante that ended in failure.  \\n>  \\n>  In FMAB & FMAM, Hohenheim was a human Philosopher\\'s Stone with a seemingly\\n> infinite supply of power. Although he was originally a slave, he was granted\\n> his near-immortality by Father well before the events of the series took\\n> place. Hohenheim is more significant in FMAB & FMAM, facing off against\\n> Father at the end of the series. Unlike FMA03\\'s Hohenheim, he dies at the\\n> end of FMAB & FMAM after finally exhausting the power of his Philosopher\\'s\\n> Stone.\\n\\n# The Gate\\n\\n> The **Gate** is the largest major change in the series. In FMAB & FMAM, the\\n> Gate is the source of all alchemy and also seems to be a source of infinite\\n> knowledge. The Gate is also guarded by a being commonly referred to as\\n> **Truth** , and who is responsible for taking the required tolls from\\n> alchemists who perform human transmutation. Those who are capable of\\n> performing alchemy have their own gate, and if that gate should be removed\\n> (by sacrificing it to Truth), they will no longer be able to perform\\n> alchemy.  \\n>  \\n>  In FMA03, the Gate is still the source of alchemy, but it also serves as a\\n> portal between the world of _Fullmetal Alchemist_ and **Earth**.\\n> Furthermore, the Gate derives its powers from the souls of those who have\\n> died on Earth and is what powers the transmutations performed by alchemists.\\n\\n', parent_id='55'),\n",

In principle I can find quotes from the VN to support everything here,\\nbut that seems like a pretty arduous task given the size of the VN.\\n\\nOf course, what follows constitute pretty major spoilers if you ever intend to\\nread the VN regarding the illusionary world and the \"lights\", though . Some of\\nthis is not discussed in any way in the anime, so I\\'ve spoiler tagged\\neverything (but if you don\\'t ever intend to read the VN, there\\'s no reason not\\nto spoil yourself).\\n\\n> In the visual novel, there are a number of \"[orbs of\\n> light](http://clannad.wikia.com/wiki/Light_orbs)\" which are also in the\\n> anime but not focused on as much. Yukine describes them to Tomoya at the end\\n> of her route, and I believe also at some point in the anime. They are\\n> capable of granting wishes, but are fairly limited in power. They are\\n> created when someone helps someone else achieve a goal which brings\\n> happiness. For unknown reasons, Tomoya is one of the few people who can see\\n> them now, although they were visible to everyone in the past. In the game,\\n> Tomoya gets one orb for each completed route (8 total), with a couple of\\n> exceptions, and 5 more are available in After-Story. All of these are needed\\n> to reach the true end where Nagisa and Ushio don\\'t die.  \\n>  \\n>  After Tomoya collects the orbs, they are transported to the illusionary\\n> world, where Ushio (the true identity of the girl who lives there) keeps\\n> them. Ushio created the illusionary world in order to save herself and\\n> Nagisa by collecting the fragments of happiness that Tomoya gathers in the\\n> form of orbs of light. She is capable of doing so because \"children are the\\n> culmination of their parents\\' hopes and dreams\" (a theme that is repeated\\n> many times in the series).  \\n>  \\n>  The only other people who are able to enter the illusionary world are those\\n> who willingly choose to do so, and Tomoya is the only person who falls into\\n> that category, so he is able to enter the body of a doll made out of\\n> garbage. Even when they made another doll, there were no more souls willing\\n> to enter the illusionary world, so it was lifeless. It isn\\'t clear whether\\n> Ushio and Tomoya in the illusionary world have their real world memories,\\n> but Tomoya in the real world definitely doesn\\'t remember the illusionary\\n> world, as evidenced by the fact that he thinks Nagisa\\'s play is nostalgic\\n> but doesn\\'t know why (Nagisa\\'s play was about the illusionary world,\\n> although she probably also doesn\\'t know this). It\\'s also not clear how the\\n> chronologies of the two worlds works, but it\\'s very likely that they are on\\n> completely different timelines. Judging by the fact that all of the\\n> illusionary world segments occur between days, he may be seeing it as a\\n> dream, but the research of the Ichinoses (Kotomi\\'s parents, both of whom are\\n> theoretical physicists) indicates that the illusionary world is very much\\n> real and is connected to our world in many ways.  \\n>  \\n>  In order to save Nagisa and Ushio, Tomoya needs to do 3 things. First, he\\n> needs to gather a lot of happiness in the form of orbs of light, enough to\\n> make such a big wish. Second, he needs to clearly tell Ushio (who is holding\\n> the orbs via her alter-ego in the illusionary world) that he doesn\\'t want\\n> her or Nagisa to die and that he wants them to live together as a family.\\n> And third, he needs to really mean what he is saying, as the orbs won\\'t\\n> grant wishes that aren\\'t what one truly desires. If all of those are\\n> completed, the orbs of light will grant his wish, returning time to the\\n> point when Ushio was born and saving both Nagisa and Ushio. It should be\\n> mentioned that in order to collect these orbs, Ushio sends Tomoya to many\\n> different timelines, each time returning him to around the same point when\\n> the anime begins and resetting his memories. This is touched upon briefly in\\n> the special episodes revolving around Kyou and Tomoyo in which we see orbs\\n> of light at the end, meaning it\\'s likely they\\'re canon and actually happened\\n> during one of the timelines Tomoya was sent to.  \\n>  \\n>  Note also that this isn\\'t the only time that the orbs of light grant wishes\\n> that would otherwise be impossible, although it\\'s definitely the most\\n> powerful instance. When Nagisa is dying for the first time and Akio wishes\\n> to the tree that she doesn\\'t die, that wish was also granted via the orbs.\\n> Also, when Misae declares her wish to Shima that she wants him to always be\\n> with her and love her, this is also granted, although unbeknownst to Misae,\\n> Shima was actually a cat and he returns to that form. In addition, depending\\n> on the order of routes that you choose in the VN, Tomoya may use an orb to\\n> pray for Fuko to get better, though if he does he\\'ll be able to get it back\\n> in After Story. So this isn\\'t as much of a deus ex machina as it might seem,\\n> but a legitimate plot point that mostly got swept under the rug in the\\n> anime.\\n\\n', parent_id='195'),\n",

Yuzuru is born.\\n  2. Kanade is born.\\n  3. Yuruzu gets in a train crash. Although he survives the initial crash, he eventually dies of thirst. Just before he dies, he signs an organ donor card. Because the rescuers arrived just barely too late, his organs could be harvested in time.\\n  4. Kanade is in need of a heart transplant. She receives a donor heart. It is Yuzuru's.\\n  5. Kanade dies. We don't know how long she lived after her heart transplant, but, it apparently saved her life, so I presume she lived a good while after it.\\n\\n**The Afterlife Timeline**\\n\\n  1. Kanade arrives in the afterlife. As per Yuri, Kanade was there before she arrived, but, we're never told for how long, so, the amount of time she spent there from her arrival to her departure is unknown.\\n  2. Events in the [_Angel Beats! Heaven's Door_ manga](http://myanimelist.net/manga/19671/Angel_Beats!_Heavens_Door) take place.\\n  3. Yuzuru arrives in the afterlife.\\n  4. Kanade and Yuzuru finally meet in person. She stabs him in the chest and notices that Yuzuru doesn't have a heart. She then realizes who Yuzuru is.\\n  5. Events in the [_Angel Beats!_ anime](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6547/Angel_Beats!) take place.\\n  6. Kanade moves on from the afterlife after thanking Yuzuru for the heart he gave her.\\n  7. As per [_Angel Beats!: Another Epilogue_](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10067/Angel_Beats!:_Another_Epilogue), Yuzuru remains in the afterlife for an undisclosed amount of time helping others move on.\\n  8. Events in the _Angel Beats!_ anime sequel (if ever released) could take place here.\\n  9. Yuzuru finally moves on from the afterlife.\\n\\n**The Alternate World Timeline**\\n\\n  1.

Each gate is a special point in the body that\\nlimits the flow of chakra. This is done in order for the body to live longer\\n(more chakra flowing = the body is expiring faster). Opening a gate lets\\nchakra flow freely through it, giving the shinobi a boost in his powers, but\\nas a price his body is suffering from that power greatly.\\n\\nEach gate gives a boost in a special power, e.g. the first gate removes the\\nrestrains on the muscles, the second improves physical strength and re-\\nenergizes the body, and so on.\\n\\nNow, opening the gates is very dangerous by itself, and it's becoming more\\ndangerous the more gates you open, that's right. The reason for that is that\\nthe body simply can't stand the chakra, and gets damaged by it. That's why\\nit's hard to open the gates, and it requires a lot of training to use them.\\nGuy has gone through a lot of training to learn to use that much gates though.\\n\\nAs for the side effects, the seventh gate (which Guy used) causes the user's\\nmuscle fibres to be\\n\\n> ripped to shreds, causing intense pain if anything or anyone touches them\\n\\nand finally the last, 8th gate gives the user some tremendous power, but costs\\nhim his life.\\n\\nSo, to summarize: since Guy has gone through a lot of training to learn to\\nopen the gates and use their power, he can use them in the battle.

These are the most common, since usually a ninja can master only one chakra nature (since normally ninjas tend to have an affiliation with only one chakra nature) \\n  * Later we discover these can be combined in a number of ways, **creating new elements** (Mokuton=Doton+Suiton, Ranton=Raiton+Suiton, Youton=Katon+Doton, among several others). From what I understand, these are usually transmitted as a Kekkei Genkai. But I believe they can also be created by the combinations of the elements, by ninja who didn't inherit it from other generations (correct me if I'm wrong). These are not uncommon, but less frequent than the ones above (there are ninja who can master and possess affiliation to more than one chakra nature: Sasuke comes to mind, since he can master both Katon and Raiton. Katon is his clan's natural affiliation, and he mastered Raiton too. However, I don't **remember** if he has ever combined the both of them) \\n  * Even later, we find about combinations of **even more elements** by ninja who can master several elements, such as Muu (Nidaime Tsuchikage) and Oonoki (Sandaime Tsuchikage), who can combine Katon, Doton and Fuuton, to create Jinton. These are called Kekkei Touta. I don't know if they can also be transmitted through Kekkei Genkai, or if they can only be taught. They are even rarer than the ones above, since ninja can rarely master or be naturally affiliated to more than two chakra natures (Terumii Mei the Godaime Mizukage, can also master Doton, Katon and Suiton, but I don't think she ever combines more than two at each time). \\n\\nMy questions are:\\n\\n  * **Are combinations of chakra natures taught or only transmitted by Kekkei Genkai (or both)?**\\n  * **Are combinations of more than three chakra natures possible?**\\n  * And the above question created a new one for me: **Can a ninja master more than three chakra natures?** (I think Kakashi does, but I am not quite sure about this)\\n\\n\", title='Is it possible to combine all five chakra elements?', accepted_answer_id='311', answer_count=9, view_count=39412, tags=['naruto'], favorite_count=0),\n",

Kakashi is shown to use 4 elements (earth, fire (only\\nin anime), water and lightning). He didn\\'t use any Wind techniques, but he was\\nable to help Naruto in his training, so he at least knows something about\\nthem. Also note that:\\n\\n  * he has natural affinity to the Lightning\\n  * he has used Water techniques on the level that matched the level of Zabuza, who is a water specialist\\n\\nSo we can say that he is a \"master\" of at least two elements, and definitely\\ncan use another two (he uses fire only in the anime, though). Now, taking that\\ninto account, I think it\\'s safe to assume that it _is_ possible to use all the\\nelements.

At least three techniques: Jinton, Yōton, and Jiton have more\\nthan one user with no apparent blood relations to each other. Also Ōnoki has\\nstated that the secrets of Jinton were passed to him by Mū, so it implies (or\\nat least suggests) that these abilities may not only be transmitted by Kekkei\\nGenkai.

Usually it's\\neither a manga, a light novel series (like Haruhi), or even visual\\nnovel/computer game (Little Busters!, the When They Cry series).\\n\\nSome parts maybe cut, changed, rearranges, and sometimes new content is added\\nall together scenes completely.\\n\\nWhile some changes are welcomed by fans, most are not. One most unwelcome\\nadditions are the so called filler episodes. A filler episode can be as short\\nas 1 episode, or as long as an entire season of the anime. These episodes were\\nnot a part of the original source content's story, and usually serve\\nabsolutely no purpose in furthering the main story.\\n\\nOne of the two main reasons that we see fillers because they are meant to buy\\ntime for the anime when the content catches up to the pace the source\\nmaterial. This delay give the authors some time to adapt more material for the\\nanime. After all, you can't really adapt something that doesn't exist yet.\\n\\nThe other reason for fillers to exist is greed. Some productions like to milk\\nan anime for more money by making a few episodes of filler in a season, to add\\nto disc sales (so fan buy _n+1_ discs instead of _n_ ). Anime productions\\nusually make the bulk of their money in disc sales.\\n\\nGenerally, fans don't like fillers for the following reasons:\\n\\n  1. They are pointless, and don't add to the plot of character development in any menaingful way. Sometimes it takes away from the action and go on bizarre tangets only to end up exactly where they began (it's was all a dream!).\\n  2. They sometimes add plotholes or other contradictions to storyline and a considered non-canonical. \\n  3. They (usually) aren't written by the same author as the original source material, so the quality and vision of the story might not be up to standards.\\n\\n\", parent_id='336'),\n",

I'm really interested in the idea of cross-\\novers in anime.

They can arise from legal agreements between the\\n> relevant copyright holders, unauthorized efforts by fans, or even amid\\n> common corporate ownership.\\n\\nI think that defines cross-overs in anime as well 'cause anime and manga\\nstories are mostly fictional, hence, may work the same way in the anime\\nindustry. Correct me if I'm wrong but the general idea I have about it is that\\nthey can only do cross-overs if they (anime characters and anime) are in the\\nsame company or copyright (e.g. Clamp).\\n\\nSo far, most of Clamp animes did cross-overs like the cross-over of the\\ncharacters of Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, Clamp School Detectives (same names\\nand faces but with different roles) to Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. Another is\\nthe popular cross-over of characters and even story of Tsubasa Reservoir\\nChronicle, XXXHolic, Kobato and several Clamp-made animes (that I might have\\nforgot to mention). Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle focuses in the cross-over\\nideas since they travel different worlds and meet the same people they met\\nfrom the previous world they've been yet with different attitude and roles.\\n\\nAnother example I know is the cross-over of Lupin III (along Fujiko and\\nothers) in a Detective Conan movie, Lupin III VS Detective Conan. And Conan\\nEdogawa's appearance in an episode of Yakitate! Japan (I'm not sure which\\nepisode it is). I don't know if Detective Conan, Lupin III and Yakitate!

In other words, an object or material made mostly of water\\n> can only be transmuted into another object with the attributes of water.\\n>\\n>\\n\\n[Source - Alchemy - Equivalent_Exchange\\n](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Alchemy#Equivalent_Exchange)\\n\\nThis can be better understood when\\n\\n> Ed repairs Al. Al has a huge hole and Ed cannot create \\'new armor\\', so he\\n> has to stretch the \\'available\\' armor in order to cover the hole. However, as\\n> it stretches, it becomes thinner, since he cannot create new material. He\\n> also uses some pieces they were able to retrieve, and those he can fuse\\n> together into the armor again, using the same mass. However, as explained\\n> above, missing pieces cannot be created out of nothing, thus the need of the\\n> stretching part.\\n\\nAlthough I am not quite sure about the last paragraph (concerning the Law of\\nNatural Providence), for it makes me think about how the philosopher\\'s stone\\nreally works...\\n\\n> How does that work?\\n\\nThe [philosopher\\'s stone](http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone)\\n\\n> is a concentration of human souls.

Anime: Mitsuki claims to be called FullMoon during the audition.  \\nManga: This happens in another moment.\\n\\n  2. > In the **Manga** , Meroko\\'s past is revealed: When alive her name was Moe and she was Mitsuki\\'s grandma\\'s best friend. She killed herself believing her friend had accepted the marriage proposal by the guy she was in love with.  \\n>  In the **Anime** , nothing is revealed except something about her Shinigami\\n> past, next to Izumi whom she loved.\\n\\n  3. > In the **Manga** , also Izumi Rio\\'s past is revealed: When alive his name was Lio. He had a hard childhood. His father died when he was still very young, while his mother went crazy for the suffering and started to mistreat him, despising him and accusing him to be the reason why her new man left her. For this reason, in order to see his mother smile again, he kills himself being run over by a train.  \\n>  Farther in the Manga, we discover that Izumi\\'s vision of his past is\\n> slightly wrong...\\n\\n  4. Manga: Fullmoon single is \"Angel\".  \\nAnime: It\\'s \"Myself\" by Myco (singer and Fullmoon\\'s voice).\\n\\n  5. Fullmoon\\'s second song Eternal Snow (always sung by Myco in the Anime only). The history of the carillon, that contains the song\\'s melody, written by Aoi for Mitsuki and that the girl finds in a closet outside of the house (where her grandma locks her for punishment), is told by Takuto when he regains his memory.\\n\\n  6. > **Anime** : Another difference about Eternal Snow, appeared in the anime only, is the challenge with Madoka who, after a snitch, decides to make her debut too using the same song. Mitsuki feels sad about this since the song was written by her father and so it belonged to the Route L. But Takasu-san, the producer, refuses to produce it and worse, decides to produce Madoka in its place. So Ooshige and Fullmoon end up being without a producer. Ooshige is however a Route L\\'s fan and so he askes Wakaouji to produce this song. He initially refuses, because he swore to stop having any relation with music. In the Anime Mitsuki runs away but she comes back after a day.  \\n>  **Manga** : Something similar happens in the manga, where a song, written\\n> by Mitsuki is then found and sung by Madoka because of Izumi. The song\\'s\\n> name is \"Princess Marmeid\". Furthermore, Wakaouji is not contacted by\\n> Ooshige, rather he spontaneously proposes himself as Mitsuki\\'s producer,\\n> since he was searching her that ran away from her house. In the manga she\\n> doesn\\'t come back until almost the end.\\n\\n  7. > **Manga** : Takuto Kira, the Shinigami, \"dies\" jumping from the hospital\\'s roof, seeing by Wakaouji. Takuto Kira received a surgery to his vocal chors, because of a cancer. They are removed and since he lost his voice and cannot sing anymore, this brings him to kill himself.  \\n>  **Anime** : When the throats problem is found out, Takuto rides a bike as\\n> fast as possible, deciding not to turn at a bend he encounters.\\n\\n  8. > **Manga** : When Takuto was alive, he had a girlfriend named Hikari, a beautiful model, that will meet Mitsuki too.\\n\\n  9. > **Anime** : Meroko is promoted from Shinigami to Angel.\\n\\n  10. Another big difference is about Eichi-kun ( **huge spoilers** ):\\n\\n> He was Mitsuki\\'s first love.  \\n>  **Anime** : He dies two months after he arrived to America. Mitsuki knows\\n> nothing about his death and will find out during her trip to America, when\\n> she decides to visit him along with Ooshige, Wakaouji, Takuto and Meroko.  \\n>  **Manga** : She knows about his death but she refuses it, so she talks as\\n> if he was still alive. This reactions sprouts from her feeling guilty\\n> because of the lack of reaction when he confessed his love for her, after\\n> kissing her.

In fact, it is shown in the\\n_Baba Yaga\\'s Castle_ mini-arc (if you excuse me for calling it a \"mini-arc\"),\\nthat Black☆Start indeed is capable of overcoming Madness, at least to some\\npoint. Note that in that mini-arc, after Black☆Star encourages the other\\ncharacters, they are able to overcome Madness as well after hardening their\\nminds.\\n\\nWe also know that later Black☆Star\\n\\n> gets the ability to use Madness Release (Hakkyou, 発狂) changing his\\n> Wavelength to one of Madness.\\n\\nHowever, according to the same\\n[wiki](http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Black%E2%98%86Star) that you\\nreferenced, even he has a possibility of slipping into Madness if he uses this\\nability for too long. It is also stated\\n[here](http://souleater.wikia.com/wiki/Madness) that the stronger the Madness\\nWavelength, the harder it is to overcome Madness.\\n\\nConsidering the above, another important note is that in Baba Yaga\\'s Castle\\nmini-arc, Black☆Star was rather far away from the source of Madness, while in\\nthe episode you mention he was _right near_ it; more than that, the source was\\nkishin himself.\\n\\nSo I think that while Black☆Star indeed has some sort of resistance to\\nMadness, his statement in that episode was partly bragging, partly\\noverestimating himself and underestimating the enemy, which eventually let him\\nsusceptible to the (quite powerfull themselves) illusions.\\n\\n', parent_id='562'),\n",

Master\\nRoshi (disguised as Jackie Chun) destroys the moon at the end of the 21st\\nWorld Martial Arts Tournament using the [MAX Power\\nKamehameha](http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/MAX_Power_Kamehameha), which\\ntakes considerably more effort than for Piccolo. In the meantime, Kami\\nrecreated the moon, so this isn't a plot hole.\\n\\nHowever, it's a good question as to why the moon is so easy to destroy, while\\nthe earth is so much harder. Part of this can be explained since the moon is\\nmuch less massive, but even then the numbers don't quite add up if we assume\\nthe Earth and Moon are the same as ours. Let's assume that physics in the DB\\nuniverse is at least somewhat similar to our own, modulo spirit attacks and\\nwhatever else. Of course, this assumption might be wrong, but if you start\\nchanging how physics works, there's no reason why the moon can't be filled\\nwith TNT so that it explodes whenever anyone so much as looks at it.\\n\\nI've made some approximations in the following calculations. I calculated the\\ngravitational binding energy of the moon to be 1.2 * 10^29 J. That's the\\nminimum amount of energy to blow up the moon so that it won't reform by its\\nown gravity, so we can assume that the characters were using at least that\\nmuch energy. That amount would be enough to knock 3.4 * 10^20 kg of matter off\\nof the surface of the earth, which is roughly 0.006% of the mass of the earth.\\nThat doesn't seem like a lot, but if we assume a uniform density of the earth,\\nthat's about 1.6 * 10^7 cubic miles of matter, which corresponds to a cube\\nwhere each side has length 250 miles. That's a pretty huge crater. So just\\nsaying that the moon is easier to blow up than the earth isn't going to cut\\nit.\\n\\nThere are 3 ways to resolve this. First, the earth and moon in the DB universe\\ncould be very different from what they are here. Specifically, the moon could\\nbe larger and less massive, and the earth smaller and more massive than in\\nreal life. However, it takes quite a bit of stretching to get believable\\nvalues, and that's ignoring the vast power difference between DBZ Goku and DB\\nRoshi. If you push things that far, I wouldn't expect it to be consistent with\\neverything else in the series. The second possibility is that the moon is\\nsomehow more vulnerable than the Earth to attacks. This is roughly what\\nAlenanno's answer says. It's entirely possible, but as far as I can tell\\nthere's little indication of this in the series apart from the Genki Dama, so\\nI don't know why other attacks directed at planets would not destroy them.\\n\\nThis leaves the third possibility, which is my personal choice: the producers\\nweren't really thinking about it when they did this, and were more concerned\\nwith making things dramatic than making them consistent. As such, I'd call\\nthis a plot hole, but it's a pretty minor one in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\", parent_id='630'),\n",

Finally, a severely damaged Aegis clings to the Strike;\\n> as the machine powers down, unable to deliver the finishing blow with its\\n> cannon, Athrun starts a self destruct sequence, and jetpacks away. The\\n> Archangel, detecting a second attacking squad, is forced off the island\\n> without the time to start a rescue operation; they send Orb a request to\\n> perform the search, and leave as soon as their engines are repaired.\\n\\nTimeframes have all been taken from the show, side materials may provide more\\naccuracy. Anyway, a review of the facts: This battle takes place around a day\\nafter the Archangel leaves Orb (the first attack is right after they leave the\\nneutral territory; the second, on dawn of the next day). The Reverend is shown\\nto live nearby, most likely on the same island. The Aegis' self destruct timer\\nis ten seconds. The Strike's cockpit is open due to damage from the battle:\\n\\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pUear.png)\\n\\nMy theory? Kira escaped as well. He likely acted quickly: from his seat, he\\ncould not only see Athrun flying away; he could also see his cockpit opening\\nbeforehand. This is the last scene we see where Kira is present, and at this\\npoint, he has had two to four seconds to figure things out - he probably fled\\nimmediately after (we see him with a look of realization shortly before; he is\\nalso in SEED mode, presumably more aware than normal).\\n\\nThe power of the explosion is significant - Athrun, found by Orb either later\\non the same day, was flung by the blast, incapacitated before landing or due\\nto it, and lightly wounded - and that was even though he employed the best way\\nto escape, starting at the earliest possible moment and with a jetpack.\\n\\nKira's wounds are more severe - the next time he is shown, he is lying in bed\\nin one of the colonies. I have no idea how long it would take to transport him\\nthere; but unless the Reverend used his priestly powers, it probably took at\\nleast a week. His awakening in Lacus' presence is implied to be his first one\\nsince he was found - yeah, in comparison to that, Athrun walked away with just\\na few scratches.\\n\\nBut where did he escape? If he had a jetpack, the answer is clear. Even if he\\ndidn't, there's yet one place he could have fled - behind the Strike. You see,\\nwhen the Aegis latches on Kira's machine, we are shown a shot of both; the\\nStrike is standing. Later, during the rescue operation, the Strike is shown\\nmostly intact - the outside layer of armor is partially melted, as well as the\\nexposed cockpit, but the machine itself is fine. The blast has toppled it over\\n- it is only a question of whether Kira was lucky to be hiding in a place\\nwhere he would be crushed or not. In any case, the torso and the power pack of\\nthe Strike form a neat bomb shelter.\\n\\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/agNn3.jpg)\\n\\nDid he have a jetpack then?

One of the major plot\\npoints in the whole series is the execution of the plan to eliminate homo-\\nsapiens by the research facility, which involves spreading the virus through a\\nlarge population by using a missile. We could say that this is half of the\\nwhole story and the anime only covered the first half.\\n\\nThe relationship between Lucy and Kouta is very similar in both the anime and\\nthe manga. The major difference is the fact that Kouta is a bit more agressive\\nregarding avenging his father and his sister, but in both cases he still tries\\nto protect Lucy (not forgiving her though).\\n\\nThe bridge incident (the ending of the anime) also differs slightly. Mariko\\ndoes forgive her father and engages Lucy in a battle. She uses the explosives\\nwithin her to attempt to kill Lucy (thus, her father actually survives and is\\nnot killed). She fails and Lucy merely loses her horns.\\n\\nThere obviously are a bunch of characters not introduced in the anime. Most of\\nthem are not critical for the storyline, though, which might explain their\\nexclusion at first.\\n\\nOne of the biggest discussions regarding the anime is whether Lucy died or not\\nat the ending. Technically, from the point of view of the manga, the answer is\\nno - she actually survived the bridge incident. She loses her horns, which\\ndisables the \"evil\" Lucy and keeps her as Nyuu. The horns grow back, however.\\n\\nAt first, it doesn\\'t seem like the anime is capable of continuing, since they\\nkilled Mariko\\'s father (whose name I forgot), who plays rather important roles\\nthrough the rest of the manga. This is fixable though, they just need to do a\\nfew tweaks and make a new scene where he somehow survives the bridge\\nexplosion.\\n\\nSo, yes: the main difference is the fact that the anime only covers half of\\nthe story, and kills some people who shouldn\\'t have died.\\n\\n', parent_id='149'),\n",

For Kurama, the\\nNine-tails, in Naruto it is 九喇嘛 (9 lamas/high priests), the real life Mount\\n[Kurama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kurama) is 鞍馬 (saddle horse), and\\nin _Yu Yu Hakusho_ 蔵馬 (hiding/ownership/storehouse horse).\\n\\n## The Bijuu (尾獣)\\n\\n  * **Juubi** , the Ten-tails, is a reference to [Ame-no-hitotsu-no-kami](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A9%E7%9B%AE%E4%B8%80%E7%AE%87%E7%A5%9E), the Shinto god of iron-working and blacksmiths, [Datara](http://eirikrjs.tumblr.com/post/118250389962/whats-the-deal-with-ippon-datara-in-japanese), and/or [Daidarabotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daidarabotchi). The former for it\\'s ability to forge living thing out of metal and the latter for giant size.\\n\\n![Bijus in child form](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PCqlL.jpg)\\n\\n  * **Kyuubi** : 九喇嘛 (クラマ; Kurama), the Nine-tails, is a reference to the [kitsune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune) in Japanese mythology. The name Kurama probably named after the mountain in Japan. It is said to be home of the Tengu God Sojobo and, more importantly, the location where the technique Reiki was first learned. Reiki is the art of using chakra (universal energy) to heal other people. This ties into Naruto\\'s life-giving energy ability he gains after tapping into the nine-tails chakra.\\n\\nHere is the Wikipedia breakdown of\\n[Reiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiki):\\n\\n> \"Reiki is commonly written as 霊気 in shinjitai kanji or as レイキ in katakana\\n> syllabary. It compounds the words rei (霊: \"spirit, miraculous, divine\") and\\n> ki (気 \"gas, vital energy, breath of life, consciousness\"). The ki (better\\n> known as Chinese qi or ch\\'i) in reiki is understood as meaning \"spiritual\\n> energy; vital energy; life force; energy of life\"\\n\\n  * **Hachibi** : 牛鬼 (ぎゆうき; Gyuuki), the Eight-tails, is based off the [Ushi-Oni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushi-oni), a sea creature commonly seen with an ox head and the body of another multi-limbed creature. The name Gyuuki (cow demon) is another pronunciation of Ushi-Oni. \\n\\n  * **Nanabi/Shichibi** : 重明 (ちようめい; Choumei), the Seven-tails, is probably based off the rhinoceros beetle which are said to be amongst the strongest creatures on the planet in relation to their own size. The name most likely is a reference to [Kamo no Choumei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamo_no_Ch%C5%8Dmei), a 12th century poet who secluded himself on society, took Buddhist vows, and became a hermit living outside the capital. Choumei is most famous for his writings that were mostly about nature and natural events. If you recall from the manga, two of the previously unseen captured Jinchuuriki\\'s were outcasts that were abandoned by their village when Akatsuki came to capture them.\\n\\n  * **Rokubi** : 犀犬 (さいけん; Saiken), the Six-tails, Saiken is based off the turban-shell snail demon, [Sazae Oni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazae-oni). The name comes from a compilation of Chinese legends called [\"In Search of the Supernatural\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Supernatural). The Saiken (犀犬) in one of the stories (地中犀犬) is a type of dog-like creature with closed eyes, the size of small dogs, that like underground in pairs (male and female).\\n\\n  * **Gobi** : 穆王 (こくおう; Kokuou), the Five-tails, is a reference to the the hanging horse head demon, [Sagari](http://yokai.com/sagari/), and the ghost whale demon, [Bakekujira](http://yokai.com/bakekujira/). Typically Kokuou translates to \"king\" (国王) in Japanese, referring to a \"lesser king,\" one below the emperor. The name probably is a reference to the Chinese legend of [King Mu of Zhou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Mu_of_Zhou) (周穆王).\\n\\n  * **Yonbi** : 孫悟空 (そんごくう; Son Gokuu), the Four-tails, is a reference to the [Satori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satori_\\\\(folklore\\\\)), an ape-like creature that can read minds. The name Son Gokuu is obviously a reference to the [Monkey King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong) in Journey to the West.\\n\\n  * **Sanbi** : 磯撫 (いそぶ; Isobu), the Three tails, is probably based of a combination of the spirit of eaten-turtles that haunt those that harmed it, [Suppon no Yurei](http://hyakumonogatari.com/2013/11/24/suppon-no-yurei-the-turtle-ghost/) and/or the amorphous sea monster, [Umibozu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umib%C5%8Dzu). Isopu is probably a reference to the shark-like demon sea monster with a barbed tail fin, [Isonade](http://yokai.com/isonade/). \\n\\n  * **Nibi** : 又旅 (またたび; Matatabi), the Two-tails, is a referenced to the forked cat demon, [Netomata](http://yokai.com/nekomata/). Matatabi is named after the [Silver Vine or Cat Powder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinidia_polygama) a plant herb similar to a [hardy kiwi vine](http://landscaping.about.com/od/vineplants1/p/kiwis.htm). Used as a healing herb for cats and affects them in a similar way as catnip. When ground up, it is used in herbal teas and bath salts.\\n\\n  * **Ichibi** : 守鶴 (しゆかく; Shukaku), the One-tail, is a reference to the shapeshifting racoon demon, [Tanuki](http://yokai.com/tanuki/). The Naruto One-tail bijuu shares several tanuki archetypes. One is from the [Bunbuku Chagama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunbuku_Chagama) tale, where a tanuki transforms into a tea kettle. In the series, the One-tail is said to have been sealed within one. Other versions of the taunki tale tell of the shrine priest being a tanuki in disguise, which ties into how the One-tail was supposedly corrupted a Hidden Sand priest. The name \"Shukaku\" probably refers to the priest of this tale.\\n\\n', parent_id='748'),\n",

The Japanese language was more-or-less\\nstandardized during the Meiji Restoration, in the late 19th century. Before\\nthat, Japan was a very isolated culture for a very long time, so a lot of\\nconcepts simply didn\\'t exist in the language. As a result, it was decided that\\nrather than creating new words for all of these concepts, they would just\\nborrow the words from other languages. Most of the words came from English,\\nthough there are also some from other western languages.\\n\\nIn this case, the words are written in katakana (カタカナ). There are a very large\\nnumber of loanwords, but it\\'s fairly standardized what is a loanword and what\\nis not. Also, some of the words are pronounced differently in Japanese than\\nEnglish (e.g. energy becomes エネルギ _(enerugi)_ with a hard g sound). In case\\nit\\'s ambiguous how to pronounce English words in Japanese, these are also\\nusually standardized.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t really represent a use of English, though. The loanwords are\\nborrowed from English, but both the meanings and pronunciations can be\\nradically different from the English words. They\\'re better described as\\nJapanese words which are based off English words. The examples you\\'ve given\\ndon\\'t really fall into the above category, but there are many examples like\\nthis so it\\'s worth mentioning.\\n\\nThe other way they can use English is just by writing/speaking in English. The\\nexamples you\\'ve given seem to fall in this category. This is done to\\nsound/look cool, because most people in Japan only hear and see Japanese for\\nmost of their day, so it stands out. Since most Japanese people have at least\\na passable knowledge of English vocabulary (it\\'s part of the standard\\ncurriculum), it\\'s a way to make a statement, sort of like how stylized fonts\\nwould be used in English except a bit stronger.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve made that distinction, we can answer the question. The answer\\nto your question \"Why do these English words make their way into otherwise\\nentirely Japanese productions?\" is that English is fairly common in Japan, not\\njust in anime/manga. This isn\\'t solely a phenomenon about anime/manga, nor am\\nI convinced that it\\'s particularly common in anime and manga. For instance,\\nyou can probably spot several instances of English in this picture of\\nadvertising in Osaka (I found 3, with another 2 cases of the Roman alphabet\\nbeing used to write non-English words, and quite a few katakana loanwords as\\nwell):\\n\\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t9epZ.jpg)\\n\\nSo in summary, it\\'s because English is common in Japanese culture. But that\\'s\\nnot a very satisfying answer by itself. Rather than answering the broad\\nquestion of why modern Japanese culture often uses English (which I think\\nmight be better posed at [Japanese.SE](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/)\\nwith some modifications) I\\'ll address the particular cases you have mentioned,\\nin part because a full answer to the former question is probably impossible\\nand in part because it\\'s off-topic.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nUsing English is very common in music, where whole lines may be written in\\n(oftentimes broken) English. This is not solely a Japanese phenomenon, as\\nKorean and Chinese pop artists also often use English (Indian pop artists do\\nso very frequently as well, but English is a fairly common language in India).\\nAs far as I can tell, it isn\\'t particularly common in anime songs, though of\\ncourse I don\\'t have any statistics to back that up.\\n\\nEssentially, it\\'s done in music to sound cool, for the reasons I listed above.\\nIt also somewhat expands their audience, since people around the world speak\\nEnglish. I don\\'t know if there\\'s an analogy that would be familiar to people\\nwho only speak English, but the closest I could come up with is that Latin is\\noccasionally used in English-language music.\\n\\nIn fact, English use in Japanese music predates J-Pop itself (which is the\\ngenre that most anime music falls in). Japanese rock musicians in the 1960s\\nand \\'70s were mostly inspired by their western counterparts, most notably the\\nBeatles. For a time, Japanese rock singers believed that the Japanese language\\nwas too restrictive to be able to sing rock-style, so most of them sung in\\nEnglish (see\\n[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-pop#Eleki_Boom_and_Group_Sounds)). The\\nfirst really successful band to sing in English was [Happy\\nEnd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_End_%28band%29), but even after that,\\npeople continued using English at least occasionally. It\\'s possible to write\\nlong academic papers on the use of English in Japanese music, but I\\'ll stop\\nhere for brevity.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nFor Digimon Tamers, and indeed many series, the title is displayed in English.\\nIn fact, most series now have both an English and a Japanese title, which do\\nnot always mean the same thing. In the case of Digimon, the word \\'Digimon\\'\\ncomes from two English words, \\'Digital\\' and \\'Monster\\'. Tamers is also an\\nEnglish word.

He does speak very rudely at times, but he's much closer to an\\naverage delinquent's (ヤンキー or _yankee_ in Japanese) speech pattern than a\\nyakuza's. The two manners of speaking are somewhat similar, because both of\\nthem are rude and disrespectful towards authority, and also somewhat cocky,\\nand indeed Ranma is supposed to come off as rude, cocky, and disrespectful to\\nauthority. However, there are definite differences. I'd probably call yakuza-\\nspeak a sub-dialect of yankee-speak, but it has a lot of specific properties\\nwhich Ranma's speech doesn't.\\n\\nRather than describing both dialects here, it'll be easier to link to places\\nthat have already done so. This [blog\\npost](http://thedailyyoji.blogspot.com/2009/02/blog-post_27.html) describes\\nsome basics of yankee speech.\\n[Here](http://www.jingai.com/yakuza/introduction.html) are a few lessons on\\nyakuza-speak. As you can see, there are similarities, but yakuza-speak goes a\\nwhole lot farther in a lot of ways and has its own vocabulary. For instance,\\nyakuza-speak usually has rolled Rs and slurred vowels (rare in yankee-speak),\\nwhile both have some vowel changes. The difference is actually pretty similar\\nto English. In English, if someone swears a lot and insults everyone all the\\ntime, you wouldn't assume they were a gang member, but you'd probably expect\\ngangsters to talk that way, and you probably also would find that person a bit\\nunpleasant even if you didn't think of them as a gangster. In all cases I\\nlooked at, Ranma seems to be squarely in the delinquent category, but not\\nreally in the yakuza category.\\n\\nIn fact, there's somewhat of a spectrum of delinquents in Japanese culture,\\nwith some speaking very similar to yakuza, and others not really fitting into\\nthe yankee archetype at all. For instance, the delinquents in Beelzebub often\\ndo roll their Rs and slur their vowels, but don't use most of the yakuza\\nvocabulary. Ranma's speech is definitely less aggressive and offensive than\\nthat, but still less respectful than how a normal person is expected to speak.\\nOn the other end, Clannad's Okazaki Tomoya is a delinquent, but mostly speaks\\nlike a normal guy, and doesn't fall into the yankee archetype at all. However,\\nit would be wrong to construe any of these characters as yakuza members unless\\nthere's evidence elsewhere. In some cases the more thugish of the delinquents\\nmay even be in gangs, but yakuza is different from just ordinary gangs (a\\nbetter analogy would be the mafia).\\n\\nHowever, the show is over 20 years old, and the yankee archetype, which was\\nvery popular in the 1980s and early 1990s during a period when action and\\nmartial arts shows were very popular, is much less common now. Ordinary\\nJapanese people may not be as accustomed to it as they were at that time, so\\nthere's somewhat more room for confusion now. Speech patterns have also\\nevolved quite a bit in that time separating the two dialects more and pushing\\nRanma further on the delinquent spectrum. Also, when Ranma transforms to a\\ngirl, she still speaks the same way, even though women are expected to speak\\nmore respectfully in Japanese society, which could lead to further confusion.\\nAnd finally, the two dialects are definitely close, so some confusion is\\npossible even without all the other factors.\\n\\nAs such, the misunderstanding is understandable, but if a person watched the\\nshow from the beginning, they would definitely not get the impression that\\nRanma is somehow related to the yakuza. Someone listening to the particular\\nclips from the song you showed could easily make that mistake, since Ranma is\\nspeaking in an especially angry tone (especially in his female form) at that\\ntime and also because there isn't very much dialogue in the first place to\\nmake the distinction.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the only source I have for this other than the above links and\\nnumber of years of studying Japanese is a 5-minute conversation with one of my\\nJapanese professors about this subject, so it's entirely possible that I'm\\nwrong about some of the above assertions. However, I do think that I'm correct\\nthat you aren't supposed to interpret Ranma as speaking like a member of the\\nyakuza, just a particularly rude and cocky teenager.\\n\\nIt's also worth noting somewhere that the average Japanese person's perception\\nof how yakuza speak is pretty different from how they actually speak. Most\\nJapanese people only know the yakuza through yakuza movies, which use a fairly\\nlimited subset of yakuza-speech to be easily understandable while still\\nsounding authentic.\\n\\n\", parent_id='140'),\n",

Each of the various manga\\n> magazines published in Japan is targeted to one of these specific\\n> demographics, resulting in about a 50-50 split between manga aimed at those\\n> under 18 and manga aimed at adults.\\n\\nAdditionally, where money made from manga is primarily sales as opposed to\\nsomething like an anime TV series where there's both a considerable investment\\nfrom the studio, sponsors, and in most cases licensing for products (like\\nfigures, T-shirts, etc.), the panel also noted that:\\n\\n> Kanemitsu opened by saying that, despite the most idealistic wishes of\\n> progressive thinkers, Japanese publishers may not necessarily be fighting at\\n> full force against censorship. Other disconnects also exist between the\\n> definitions of obscenity and child pornography in Japan versus the United\\n> States, and also how the different cultures conduct business.\\n\\nIn anime, sponsorship and how much a TV studio has to play in anime\\nproductions is a much greater influence than the stores that sell manga has\\nover mangaka and editors. Cowboy Bebop was originally taken off the air mid-\\nway when it first aired because TV Tokyo said it was too violent. There were\\npurportedly studio and sponsorship pressure on GAINAX during the original run\\nof Evangelion.\\n\\nThen you have late-night and satellite TV anime series which show nudity and\\nviolence, or OVAs which, as long as properly labeled, can be borderline\\npornography. The former has lax studio pressure and the sponsors already know\\ntheir demographic. The later is not much different from how manga is sold and\\ndistributed, at a store where titles that would normally be censored are\\nlabeled appropriately or are in their own sections.\\n\\nAs quoted above, because of the way manga is distributed, there's a 50/50\\nsplit between manga produced for under 18 and those for adults. So you have a\\nlot more content that's risque or violent in manga because of the split. A few\\ndecades ago when most of the distribution of anime were straight to video, a\\nlot more shows contained nudity and violence, even ones that weren't\\nnecessarily aimed at adults. But because of the distribution method, the\\nanimation studios themselves had a lot more control over what they could write\\nand animate. Around the mid-to-late 90's, TV studios started airing more and\\nmore shows, and they had their own guidelines on what they would and wouldn't\\nair so even the incidental nudity and blood were taken completely out if\\nanimation studios wanted to produce a TV show that aired on a national station\\nduring the day. Note that when a show that aired on TV, that needed to be\\ncensored so the stations would air them, makes it onto physical media like\\nDVD's and Bluray's, those white/black washes, glares, steam, etc. are all\\nremoved and are uncensored.\\n\\n\", parent_id='862'),\n",

I don\\'t know anything about Naruto canon, so I have no official\\nsource, but swastikas are often highly stylized and this certainly fits the\\nbill. Googling for \"Hindu swastika\" or \"Buddhist swastika\" will yield plenty\\nof images, some of which are pretty distorted (more than the image you\\'ve\\nposted), so it\\'s very likely not a coincidence. For instance, this Hindu\\nswastika is very common:\\n\\n![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEaRo.gif).\\n\\nSwastikas are common in Buddhism, Hinduism, and many other eastern religions\\n(Buddhism being the most common in Japan), and are well-known in both the East\\nand West, though with different interpretations. In particular, in Buddhism,\\nthe swastika is usually counter-clockwise (Nazi swastikas were clockwise, and\\nthe seal you have posted is counter-clockwise as one would expect of a\\nBuddhist swastika). It doesn\\'t have quite the same meaning as you\\'ve described\\nin Buddhism; most Buddhists think of the Swastika as a symbol for eternity,\\nprotection, and good luck.\\n\\nIn Japanese, this Buddhist symbol is called _manji_ or 卍字 and is used as a\\nsort-of official symbol for Buddhism similar to how crosses represent\\nChristianity. Maps usually indicate Buddhist temples with these manji. While\\nJapanese people (as well as most other Eastern cultures) would recognize the\\nNazi swastika by it\\'s design, they would not associate all swastikas with\\nNaziism as many would in the West. In short, I\\'d be extremely surprised if\\nanyone coincidentally drew one in a manga without intending some symbolism,\\nand it\\'s a common enough symbol that there may not be any official mention of\\nit.

Your best bet here is to look for ones that are used by other students and try and examine it yourself. Also, remember that you will need to get used to Japanese before you feel really comfortable using the dictionary unless you limit yourself to the romanized ones (i.e. [Random House Japanese-English English-Japanese Dictionary](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0679780017)).\\n  2. **How long can I use the dictionary for?** If you are planning sticking with Japanese and learning the language then investing in a more expensive dictionary might prove useful (i.e. [The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/4770028555)); however, if you just need a quick reference for a trip then you don't need an extensive one.\\n  3. **How will the dictionary help me learn?** Beyond the obvious use of the dictionary to look-up new works that you are unfamiliar with, some might prove better than others for learning the words once you look them up. Having the furigana (i.e. [Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/4770024800)) on hand with the kanji will help students in that they now see the words in question in two different scripts in addition to the the definition that they are looking for.\\n\\nBeyond that, a dictionary will come down to a bit of personal preference,\\nwhile the ones previously mentioned could cover most of the basis and provide\\na wide coverage of the language, you may eventually graduate to the point\\nwhere a proper Japanese language dictionary is required or you may desire\\nsomething a bit more exotic such as a loan-words only dictionary.\\n\\n\", parent_id='25'),\n",

I\\'m going to attempt to synthesize some of that\\nhere, but Kuno\\'s explanation is much more complete. I wrote most of this as an\\nanswer to a similar question on an internet forum about a year ago, so if you\\nfind it there, that\\'s me too.\\n\\nThere are two meanings to は, and three for が. は is used for contrast and\\nthematic reference. が is used as a direct object marker for certain\\nverbs/verbals, an exhaustive subject marker, and as a \\'neutral-descriptive\\'.\\n\\nは is often called the \\'topic marker\\', in contrast to the \\'subject marker\\' of\\nが, but the key difference is context. Imagine, if you will, a big box of\\nthings that have been mentioned in a conversation. We\\'ll call this box the\\n\"universe of discourse\". Certain constructions can only be used with things\\nthat are in this \"universe\". This sounds ridiculously abstract, until you\\nrealize that we do this in English as well.\\n\\n**English Anaphoric Phrases** :\\n\\n> The boy was bouncing a ball off the store wall.\\n\\nis not a valid sentence in isolation.\\n\\nNow, several of you are freaking out right now, since that seems like a\\nperfectly reasonable English phrase. It is... but not without context. If I\\nstart the conversation with that phrase, I\\'ve left out enough important\\ndetails that you\\'d be reasonable to suspect I was playing a game of quotations\\n(or insane...).\\n\\n> I saw a boy in Wallgreen\\'s last night. The boy was bouncing a ball off the\\n> store wall.\\n\\nprovides the needed context. The first sentence introduces a boy into the\\ncontext of the conversation, the \"universe of discourse\", and \"The\" selects\\nhim out of it as the particular object I wish to make a statement on.\\n\\n> A boy was bouncing a ball off the store wall in Wallgreen\\'s.\\n\\nis perfectly reasonable. From this we can see that we use \"A\" to introduce\\nelements to our \"universe of discourse\", and \"the\" to select them out. There\\nare several things that are considered to be always in this universe, such as\\npersonal referents. Note my first example is perfectly fine if your listener\\nis aware you have a son. This can get a bit messy in English, so let\\'s head to\\nJapanese before the analogy fails.\\n\\n**Thematic wa**\\n\\nIn Japanese, the thematic は is used with generic noun phrases (\"the brits\") or\\nthings that are already in the universe of discourse. It\\'s sometimes tricky to\\nnail down exactly what is there, but the general idea is that you don\\'t\\nintroduce things to the conversation using thematic は。 This is why you cannot\\nuse question words with は, the non-specified referent cannot be in the\\nuniverse of discourse. (だれは来ましたか?) <\\\\--- BAD! INVALID! DO NOT USE!\\n\\n**Contrastive wa**\\n\\nContrastive は, on the other hand, is much more free, and this partly explains\\nwhy 「雨は降っていますが、たいしたことはありません」 is valid, while 「雨は降っています。」 is not.** Note that\\nthis is more complicated than the textbook contrastive は, as the contrast\\nextends through the meaning of the final predicate, not just the things before\\nthe は marker.\\n\\nAnd unfortunately it can be ambiguous which は you\\'re looking at. Kuno\\'s\\nexample is 「わたくしが知っている人はパーティーに来ませんでした」. If read as thematic は (if you were\\ntalking about all the people you know... such as all your new Japanese\\nfriends), it means \"Speaking of the people I know, they did not come to the\\nparty\". If you read it as contrastive, it means \"People came to the party, but\\nnone that I know.\"\\n\\nThere can be only one thematic は in a sentence. If you see a second one, the\\nsecond is certainly contrastive, and the first might be.\\n\\n**On to が...** The first meaning of が is trivial, the direct object of certain\\nverbs, particularly those having to do with personal capability or preference,\\nreplacing the normal direct object particle を, e.g.「だれが映画が好きですか？」. This is\\nadequately covered elsewhere, and aside from the curious subset of verbs on\\nwhich this is used, is mostly uninteresting.\\n\\n**Exhaustive listing ga vs neutral description ga**\\n\\nThe other two meanings, exhaustive-listing and neutral description, are a bit\\ntricky to understand. Any が can be an exhaustive-listing が, but neutral\\ndescription only works with action verbs, existential verbs, and\\nadjectives/nominal adjectives that represent state change. \"Sentences of\\nneutral description present an objectively observable action, existence, or\\ntemporary state as a new event.\" Neutral description is a valid way of\\nintroducing something to the universe of discourse, but it is far from the\\nonly one.\\n\\n**For predicates with stative verbs or adjectives/nominal-adjectives of\\npermanent states, が can only be interpreted as exhaustive-listing.**\\nExhaustive-listing works similar to contrastive は, implying contrast to the\\nrest of the universe of discourse.\\n\\n> A:「だれが日本語を知っていますか？」 B:「ジョンが日本語できます」\\n\\nできる is a non-action verb, so this is exhaustive-listing. Assume that we are\\ntalking about the three new students: Jon, Bill and Tom. If B knows that Jon\\nand Tom can both speak Japanese, B just lied. If B knows Jon can speak\\nJapanese, but doesn\\'t know about the others, the contrastive は is appropriate\\nto use instead of が.\\n\\nNote that this is only a quick overview of the whole topic, and each of these\\nuses has special-cases that bends the rules... but this is a decent summary of\\nthe common cases.\\n\\n** It\\'s very hard to think of a valid way to introduce rain (in a non-general\\nway) to the conversation without it falling. I\\'m sure someone can dream up a\\nway for it to work, but for the general meaning of \"it\\'s raining\", は is not\\ncorrect.\\n\\n', parent_id='22'),\n",

There are Chinese words that don't exist in Japanese, and many\\nChinese Kanji have different meanings or pronunciations, as well as\\noccasionally being written slightly differently. These differences are\\nparticularly profound in words with grammatical significance:\\n\\n  * 你 (cn: nei5; jp: ni, ji, nanji) - Chinese for 'you'. Very common in Chinese, rare in Japanese (other words are used instead)\\n  * 我 (cn: ngo5; jp: wa, ware) - Chinese for 'me'. In Japanese carries a connotation of referring to yourself as a representative of a larger group, and is therefore somewhat uncommon.\\n  * 的 (cn: dik1; jp: teki) - Chinese possessive particle; has a function similar to の in Japanese. In Japanese, this is a suffix meaning 'the essence of'. You see this used in, eg, 攻撃的 or 積極的, but it is not used the same way as in Chinese at all.\\n\\nThere are also differences in usage patterns for modern inventions - eg,\\nChinese uses 电脑 for 'computer', but in Japanese the katakana コンピューター is more\\ncommon.\\n\\nAs for whether there are more words in Japanese than other languages, I\\ncouldn't say.

The derived verbs like 飲ます where the derivation adds the\\nmeaning “make/let” are called 使役動詞 in the Japanese grammar. 飲ませる consists of\\n飲ま (the 未然形 of 飲む) and an auxiliary verb せる (make/let). The same applies to\\n死なす and 死なせる, both of which are made from the verb 死ぬ (to die).\\n\\nAlmost the same explanation applies to 生かす and 生きさせる, both of which are made\\nfrom the verb 生きる (to live), but there are two complications here.\\n\\n  * The verb 生かす has an additional meaning: to utilize. Therefore, 生かす and 生きさせる are not always interchangeable.\\n  * The phrase 生きさせる consists of 生き and させる. 生き is the 未然形 of 生きる, and させる is an auxiliary verb which has the same meaning as せる. The distinction between せる and させる depends on the verb to which it is attached, but I will not go into details now.\\n\\n生かせる is a verb derived from the verb 生かす using another method of derivation,\\nand it means “can make … live” or “can utilize / can be utilized.”\\n\\n_Edit_ : In revision 1, I used the term “conjugation” incorrectly.\\n\\n', parent_id='130'),\n",

They take famous essays and short stories and layout the Japanese on one page with explanations in English on the opposite page. These have been great because it allows you to read REAL Japanese but when you come across a term you don\\'t know it\\'s right there on the opposite page.

I live in Japan so I can find language exchange partners relatively easily, however for people overseas you can easily find language exchange partners on Skype for free. \\n\\n  * Writing.

In general, no\\nmatter the language, whenever you see a discrepancy between spelling and\\npronunciation that is not entirely regular, this is the result of sound\\nchanges. And while there are some counter-examples of words that have changed\\ntheir spelling to something that doesn't reflect any prior pronunciation due\\nto [folk etymology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology) (such as the\\nEnglish word `island`, which was thought to come from the Latin `insula` so a\\ntotally superfluous `s` was inserted there) , they are rather rare.\\n\\nIn the case of the unruly Japanese particles を, は and へ, they all reflect an\\nearlier pronunciation that was retained in spelling for many words in\\n[historical kana usage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_kana_usage),\\nbut after the major language reforms of 1946, this conservative spelling was\\nkept only for these 3 particles.\\n\\nTo see what happened here exactly, we first have to get acquainted with\\ntraditional kana, that had two extra letters (ゑ and ゐ in hiragana). These\\nletters are usually transliterated as WE and WI respectively, and that was\\nindeed their pronunciation in Old and probably Classical Japanese. In the\\nearly 20th century however, the entire W-column (ワ行) has merged with the\\nvowel-column (ア行), except for the letter わ itself. As for the H-column (ハ行),\\nit merged even earlier with the ワ行 in some positions (between vowels), as I've\\nexplained in [my other\\nanswer](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/348/why-is-pronounced-as-\\nwhen-used-as-a-topic-particle). Since the ハ行 was already merged with the ワ行\\nfor these positions, it also underwent the merger with the ア行 when it came. So\\nto lay it out more clearly, this is the order of the changes:\\n\\n  1. /p/ softens to /f/ and becomes /w/ between vowels. \\n    1. は (originally pronounced as PA) is now pronounced WA. \\n    2. へ (originally pronounced as PE) is now pronounced WE. \\n  2. /w/ disappears before all vowels except /a/. \\n    1. は (previously pronounced as WA) remains WA. \\n    2. へ (previously pronounced as WE) becomes E. \\n    3. を、ゑ、ゐ (originally pronounced as WO, WE, WI) become O, E, I.  \\n\\nUp to 1946, you could find, for instance, spellings such as アヲイ (for 青い, the\\ncolor blue) and アヲヒ (a name for a family of flowers, sometimes translated as\\nHollyhock). `awoi` underwent the disapperance of `w` and became `aoi`, while\\n`awopi` became first `awowi` and then `aoi`.\\n\\n\", parent_id='379'),\n",

While most Japanese would count Okinawan as a dialect of Japanese (though it's usually officially called 沖縄方言, _Okinawan regional speech_ , and not 沖縄弁), most linguists tend to view it as an entirely different language related to Japanese, just like English and German are related. For what it's worth, Okinawan and Japanese are completely and utterly mutually unintelligible.

Some of them\\nbelong to the Malvaceae family, which also includes Genus Alcea (the flowers\\ncalled Hollyhock in English), but some of them belong to an entirely different\\nfamily. Wasabi is apparently similar enough to some of them, like\\n[カンアオイ](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AA%E3%82%A4),\\nso the kanji chosen to represent it in meaning was mountain Aoi.\\n\\nAs for the origin of the word itself (disregarding the kanji its written in),\\nthere is no clear answer.

Some unproven theories can be found at\\n[Gogenjiten](http://gogen-allguide.com/wa/wasabi.html):\\n\\n  1. It\\'s an abbreviation of the expression 悪障疼（* _わ_ *る * _さ_ *わり ひ* _び_ *く), which probably means something along the lines of \\'causing horribly irritating pain\\'.\\n  2. The わさ in わさび comes from わしる, which is an old pronunciation of the verb 走る（はしる), _to run_ , and it describes the pungent taste that \"runs\" all the way to your nose, while the び is the denasalized form of 実（み）, _fruit_ or _nut_.\\n  3. The last theory is that the name comes from 早葵 , which was pronunced `wasaapupi` in Old Japanese and written わさあふひ in historical kana usage (today it would be just わさあおい). This transformed (with a little elision and voicing of the ending syllable `pi`) to `wasabi`.\\n\\n', parent_id='500'),\n",

But first, we have to see how Old Japanese (the Japanese spoken circa\\n800 CE) sounded:\\n\\n>   1. The pronunciation of all columns was more persistent. For instance, ち\\n> was probably pronounced `TI` instead of `CHI`, and じ was pronounced `ZI`\\n> instead of `JI`.\\n>\\n>   2. entire H-column (は行) was pronounced (persistently) with the sound /p/.\\n> i.e. は was `PA`, へ was `PE`, ふ was `P`U, etc.\\n>\\n>   3. There were a few kana symbols that represent sounds that don't exist\\n> anymore: を represented `WO`, ゑ represented `WE` and ゐ represented `WI`. `WO`\\n> now represents the sound `O`, which but the separate letter still remains\\n> and it is used more or less exclusively for the particle を. The other two\\n> letters (ゐ and ゑ) have been removed from the alphabet in [the reform of\\n> 1946](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_spelling_reform#Reforms).\\n>\\n>\\n\\nDuring the time that passed since then, the spoken Japanese language has\\nnaturally changed quite a bit, and many sounds have been either lost or\\ntransformed:\\n\\n>   1. The consonant `/p/` became `/f/` and later `/h/` (though the\\n> pronunciation `/f/` remained before the vowel `/u/`.\\n>\\n>   2. Between vowels, however, the consonant `/p/` usually changed to `/w/`\\n> and merged with the existing 4 sounds in the W-column (わ・ゐ・ゑ・を), while ふ\\n> merged with う (since there was no separate letter or sound for `WU`).\\n>\\n>   3. Later still, the sound /w/ disappeared anywhere except for before the\\n> vowel `/a/`, so ゐ・ゑ・を merged with い・え・お.\\n>\\n>   4. At more or less the same time, there were some vowel contractions (\\n> _monophthongizations_ in linguistic techspeak) that caused adjacent pairs of\\n> vowels to be pronounced like one (usually long) vowel. These included the\\n> following:\\n>\\n>     * あう -> おお (remember that also includes わふ -> わう -> をお -> おお etc.)\\n>     * おう -> おお (including をふ, をう and おふ)\\n>     * えい -> ええ (including ゑい, えひ, etc.)\\n>     * いう -> ゅう (e.g. 十, which was `jip` in Middle Chinese and じふ in Old\\n> Japanese, became じゅう).\\n>     * えう -> ゃう -> ょう (e.g. けふ in 今日 become きょう)\\n>   5. It should be noted that small kana wasn't used (at least most of the\\n> time) in the old kana usage, so じゃない would have been written じやない, and あった\\n> would have been written あつた.\\n>\\n>\\n\\nWhile all these changes occurred, the spelling conventions remained mostly\\nunchanged. There were some attempts at reform during the Meiji period, but\\nbesides throwing away the\\n[Hentaigana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentaigana), they didn't work out.\\nIf we look back at the situation before WWII, the pronunciation was more or\\nless the same as today, but words were being spelled as if they were\\npronounced in Old Japanese, which was quite confusing since a word pronounced\\nin one way could be written in several different ways even when it was written\\nin kana (not to mention kanji :)), and you had to know which of them was the\\ncorrect one.\\n\\nSome interesting examples are:\\n\\n>   * オウ (応), ワウ (王), アフ (凹), ヲウ (翁), ワフ (奥). All are now normalized as オウ.\\n>   * All the verbs now ending in う used to end in ふ, 闘う・戦いたい was 戦ふ・戦ひたい.\\n>\\n\\n(note that the spelling おう, which is pronounced the same as おお, along with the\\nspelling えい, which is pronounced the same as ええ are the only two old spellings\\nthat remain in use).\\n\\nYou can find more examples and information\\n[here](http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/historical-kana-usage.html) (although the\\narticle at this link has a few minor mistakes).\\n\\n\", parent_id='567'),\n",

Dialects are hard to count - you can subdivide dialects (e.g. Kyoto-ben, Osaka-ben, Kobe-ben) or join them into bigger groups (Kansai-ben).\\n\\n  2. Some dialects are really common and others are really small, some (Osaka-ben) are very much alive and others (\"classical\" Kyoto-ben) are practically dead, but it\\'s hard to decide where to put the line.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, dialectal variation in Japanese is dying out, but some\\nbigger regional dialects are still quite strong. The following big regional\\ndialects are rather well-known:\\n\\n  * **Kantō dialect** (関東弁) which is centered in Tōkyō and is also the basis for standard Japanese. This is the dialect of central-eastern Honshū (the main island of Japan).\\n\\n  * **Kansai dialect** (関西弁) which is centered around Ōsaka, and is especially identified with its Osaka sub-dialect (大阪弁). This is the dialect of western Honshū.\\n\\n  * **Tōhoku dialect** (東北弁) which is spoken in north-eastern Honshū. It\\'s considered rather rural and rough compared to the urban Kansai and Kanto dialects, and it\\'s often used to characterize Inaka-people in fiction. It\\'s also considered rather slurred and hard to understand, and it\\'s often called Zuzu-ben (because for southern Japanese speakers words such as _sushi_ and _susu_ sound the same when spoken in this dialect). The Japanese spoken in Hokkaidaō is also very similar to this dialect.\\n\\n  * **Southwestern dialects** Here I put everything from Southwestern Honshū (including Hiroshima) to Shikoku and Kyūshū. These dialects (except for Yakuza-style Hiroshima-ben perhaps) are less commonly represented in TV and fiction, and I\\'m quite bad at differentiating between them, though some of them (especially Kagoshima-ben) are supposed to be quite distinct. Their most striking feature is that most of them use じゃ as copula (instead of や in Kansai and だ in the rest of Japan).\\n\\n  * **Ryukyuan languages** are also worth mentioning (although your unlikely to hear them at all in Tokyo), because they are not really a bunch dialects, but rather a tight language group that shares common roots with Japanese. They are utterly unintelligible to Japanese speakers and share little in common even with the most southern dialects of Kagoshima. Of these languages, the Okinawan language is the most famous, but the sad truth is that practically all of them are mostly being spoken only by older people in the Ryūkyū islands and they are dying out. \\n\\n', parent_id='654'),\n",

This seems to be _moreso_ the case with\\nphysical objects rather than abstract concepts.\\n\\nFor example, 人 - person - (called \"nin-ben\" as the left radical): 休、体、代、伝\\n([human] rest, body, generation/change, transfer). (At least one) root meaning\\nof each of these kanji involves people (伝える has a very strong sense of\\n\"transfer information from person to person\").\\n\\nA better example is something like 魚 (sakana-hen). I can\\'t think of a SINGLE\\nkanji that has 魚 on the left side that doesn\\'t relate to fish/ocean (look at a\\nsushi menu).\\n\\nThings in \"nature\" are pretty consistent: the names of trees pretty much\\nalways have ki-hen, 木. 松、柳、杉、楓、樫. (pine, willow, cedar, maple, oak). 林 means a\\ngrove of trees. From there it gets more abstract - a desk was probably\\ntraditionally made from wood, so つくえ is 机.\\n\\nOnce we get abstract, though, it gets messy. 心 means heart, so usually\\nrisshin-ben (when it\\'s a line with two marks on the left) is related to\\nemotional/feeling kanji: 慎 (prudent)、慣 (become accustomed to)、忙 (busy). Sure,\\nwe can all make the argument that one is \"busy\" and that affects the\\nheart/emotion, but really, when we start making parallels like this, I start\\nsounding more like stories from \"Remembering the Kanji\" as opposed to a real\\nhistory of the character.\\n\\nNOW, as for radicals on the right side of the kanji, they often provide the\\nsound of the on-yomi prononciation. The kanji 官 means \"official\", as in like a\\nbureaucrat (in the word 官僚). Yet, the 官 structure is part of other kanji - and\\ntakes the onyomi along with it.\\n\\nThe word ryokan (旅館 - Japanese inn)\\'s \"kan\" kanji includes it, as does kanri\\n(管理, control, administer). Note that in the case of 管理, it\\'s not on the right\\n- it\\'s below the radical, 竹, called take-kanmuri (kanmuri means \"crown\", note\\nthat it\\'s on top, not on the left). 棺 (ひつぎ - coffin) is pronounced \"kan\" in\\nonyomi (also note that it has ki-hen, because coffins are often made of\\nwood!).\\n\\nHope this helps...\\n\\n', parent_id='700'),\n",

It\\ndoes help to know that certain kanji (such as \"heart\" and \"grass\") get\\ntransformed into simpler versions for use as radicals, but beyond this it\\'s\\nmore important to see complex kanji as groups of less-complex kanji, one of\\nwhich may be a radical. This makes it easier to learn the meaning (if you use\\na mnemonic system) and the strokes (since you\\'re not learning individual\\nstrokes, but clusters of strokes). In my case, I taught myself how to read\\nmore than 2,000 kanji without once worrying about which radical group a\\ncertain character belongs to.\\n\\nThe only time you _might_ need to know the names of the radicals is when\\nsomeone is trying to describe what a certain character looks like (say, over\\nthe radio) and gives the radical first.

You know that the `たかった` in 見たかった is the part that changes by\\nconjugation, it definitely has to be part of the okurigana. All other forms of\\nthe verb 見る wouldn\\'t give you any problem either.\\n\\nI guess your problem really begins when you get to verbs like 変える and 帰る. Both\\nlook essentially the same in their Rentaikei (base) forms, and in both only\\nthe last syllable (る) changes - so why is the え in 変える spelled out in the\\nokurigana, while it is considered part of the Kanji in 帰る?\\n\\nThe answer for that is that the え here is part of the derivational suffix. If\\nwe look at the verb\\'s history, then it\\'s original stem was actually `kap-`,\\nfrom which both `kaperu` (written かへる in old spelling and かえる today) and\\n`kaparu` (written かはる in old spelling and かわる today) are derived. As you can\\nsee, two different derivational suffixes have been attached to this verbal\\nroot to create the transitive (`kap **eru**`) and intransitive (`kap **aru**`)\\nversions of the verb.\\n\\nThese origin of these derivational suffixes may be a bit obscure nowadays, but\\nit\\'s still easy to recognize the difference between 変える and 帰る by just\\ncomparing them to their counterpart verbs written with the same kanji: 変わる and\\n帰す. You can see that in 変わる the two last syllables change and in 帰す only the\\nlast syllable changes. That\\'s why writing down the derivational suffixes in\\nokurigana is still relevant even today: because these parts of the verb\\n**still change**.\\n\\nNow, it should be noted here (and it was already noted by istrasci, in fact)\\nthat some verbs have more than one acceptable okurigana. Looking at older\\ntexts, it seems to me that the standardization of okurigana is actually quite\\nrecent, so we naturally have quite a few exceptions, whether they are\\nofficially (or semi-officialy) accepted or not. But these exceptions to the\\nrule shouldn\\'t bother you most of the time, since all it really means is that\\nyou have **an extra form** , for which the derivational suffixes aren\\'t fully\\nspelled out in okurigana (e.g. 捕われる, which derives from 捕る) - the other form\\n(with fully spelled out derivational suffixes) is still accepted, and usually\\nit\\'s also the more common one.\\n\\nAs for い-\"adjectives\", they are a bit easier (like istrasci has noted), since\\nthey are less often derived, but you should pay attention to the cases where\\nsuch adjectives are derived. They\\'re usually easy to detect because of the\\nending: adjectives ending with ない (such as 少ない and もったいない/勿体ない, but not 汚い),\\nたい (重たい) and しい (悲しい、親しい).\\n\\n', parent_id='726'),\n",

There are times where は marks things that have nothing to do with the\\nsubject of the sentence. There are times where you have to choose between は\\nand を for example.\\n\\n今はどうしようかな？ = What should I do now? Sometimes the は will be left off, but が\\ncould never be used here because it\\'s not the subject (the subject is implied\\nto be the speaker -- or it could be the listener or whoever the context\\nsuggests). The function of は in a sentence like this is contrastive... \"I\\'ll\\ndo such and such tomorrow, but what should I do _now_?\"\\n\\nAs for when は replaces を, consider a sentence such as 魚はよく食べるけど、寿司はあまり食べない。\\nHere you\\'re contrasting the two things: \"As for fish, I eat it often, but as\\nfor sushi, I rarely eat it.\"\\n\\nThink of は as separate from the subject of the sentence. Think of 私はもう行きます not\\nas \"I\\'m going now\", but rather something more like \"As for me, I\\'m going now.\"\\nNotice how \"me\" occurs twice in the latter sentence (the second time under the\\nguise of \"I\", but both are 私). The 私は says \"We\\'re gonna talk about me and what\\nI\\'m gonna do.\" You could add 私が after it for the \"I\" in \"I\\'m going\" -- but why\\nwould you? We already know that you\\'re the one who\\'s going to be going, since\\n\"As for me, he\\'s going\" would make no sense. I did this in my translation of\\nthe fish/sushi example, too; notice the way I worded it when a more natural\\ntranslation would have been \"I eat fish often, but I rarely eat sushi.\"\\n\\nAnother thing that helps is to imagine sentences as answering questions, even\\nif the questions weren\\'t actually asked.

This -ou is pronounced as a long vowel /oː/.\\n  * If the vowel is -i, ウ音便 is -yuu: たのしく→たのしゅう, おいしく→おいしゅう.\\n  * If the vowel is -u, ウ音便 is -uu: さむく→さむう.\\n  * (If the vowel is -e, ウ音便 should be -you, pronounced as a long vowel /joː/, but see below.)\\n  * If the vowel is -o, ウ音便 is -ou: おそく→おそう. This -ou is also pronounced as a long vowel /oː/.\\n\\n(I could not think of any i-adjective whose dictionary form ends with -ei, and\\nthe only adjective of this form in\\n[EDICT](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict.html) is [執念い\\n(しゅうねい)](http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&p=%E5%9F%B7%E5%BF%B5%E3%81%84&dtype=0&dname=0ss&stype=0&pagenum=1&index=109091300000),\\nwhich I had never heard of. The pattern above is estimated from the discussion\\nbelow.)\\n\\nThese forms of ウ音便 are the result of two sound changes.\\n\\n  * In the first step, く was replaced by う: はやく→はやう, たのしく→たのしう, さむく→さむう, おそく→おそう.\\n  * In the second step, the -au became -ou and the -iu became -yuu: はやう→はよう, たのしう→たのしゅう. (This sound change is not limited to ウ音便 of i-adjectives, and in other words, -eu became -you with pronunciation /joː/. This is why I wrote the ウ音便 of i-adjectives ending with -ei should be -you.)\\n\\n### Why sometimes with the prefix お and sometimes without お?\\n\\nI can explain this only partly.\\n\\nThe prefix お shows respect. おはようございます literally means “You are early,” and\\nおめでとうございます literally means “(what happened to you) calls for celebration.” In\\nthese cases, the adjectives describe something about “you,” hence the prefix\\nお. On the other hand, in the sentence たのしゅうございます “I have fun,” the adjective\\nたのしい describes the state of “me,” hence no prefix お.\\n\\nHowever, this argument suggests ありがとうございます should have the prefix お because it\\nliterally means “What you did is hard to exist,” and the subject of ありがたい is\\nthe action of “you.” I do not know any explanation why ありがとうございます is not\\nおありがとうございます.\\n\\n', parent_id='765'),\n",

When and how did small-tsu come to represent consonant gemination.\\n>   2. When and how did consonant gemination (as represented by small-tsu)\\n> come to be in Japanese.\\n>\\n\\n(For those who don't know the term:\\n[gemination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination) simply means doubling of\\nsounds, usually consonants. It's easy to get the sense once you see it comes\\nfrom the same Latin root as Gemini).\\n\\nThe answer for the first question is simpler, and was already given: in\\n[historical kana usage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_kana_usage),\\nconsonant gemination was originally represented either by a full-size つ or by\\nanother consonant that got elided (usually that would be く, as in 学校, which\\nwas written ガクカウ in old spelling, or き as in 石鹸, originally: セキケン). The small-\\ntsu spelling is recent. It was used sometimes even in the 19th century to\\nindicate that the sound got elided, if not earlier, but small kana letters\\nbecame a standard only following the 1946 spelling reform.\\n\\nThe answer for the second question is trickier. I don't have any historical\\nlinguistics books that I can check to get a definite answer for when the\\nchange happened, but it couldn't be earlier than the Heian period, and it was\\nprobably earlier than the 17th century. The reason for the change was quite\\nsimple: it happened in places where the sounds く and つ were already pronounced\\nwithout the vowel (as still happens today in words such a ドクター and いつか which\\nare usually pronounced `[doktaa]` and `[itska]`).\\n\\nFrom here, the process that happened is quite simple: in words like 学校 the\\ngemination was already there once the vowel disappeared and the word was\\npronounced `[gakkou]`. In words like 血気, `[ketuki]` (you have to remember that\\nつ was originally pronounced [tu]) became `[ketki]` and the `/t/` became\\nassimilated to `/k/`, so in the end we got `[kekki]`.\\n\\nThere are also some cases where the gemination was not caused by an elided\\nconsonant, but from the elision of a long vowel (like [真赤]{まあか} `[maaka]`,\\nwhich became [真っ赤]{まっか} `[makka]`) or just because speakers decided to make\\nthe word longer for emphasis or some other reason (that's what happened in\\nきっと, which was originally きと).

In speech, you\\'re far\\nmore likely to hear あって.\\n\\nNow as for where these come from and where else they can be used, let\\'s look\\nat nouns as an example. Recall that である can be used in place of だ:\\n\\n> 彼は監督である。 He is a manager.\\n\\nNow in modern Japanese, you wouldn\\'t hear this in speech, because である has been\\nrelegated to the status of \"literary construction\". But what if you wanted to\\nsay, \"He is both a manager and a player.\"? You might be tempted to say\\nsomething like this:\\n\\n> 彼は監督も選手もである。\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is incorrect. To fix this, we use である behind each noun,\\nwith the も particle in between the で and the ある:\\n\\n> 彼は監督でもあり、選手でもある。 He is both a manager and a player.\\n\\n(In speech, you would replace the あり with あって, but the last ある will stay the\\nsame.)\\n\\nAnd since we can treat the ある in である just like the regular verb ある (some\\ngrammatical purists may argue that it\\'s not in the same category, but oh\\nwell), we can apply this strategy to negatives:\\n\\n> 彼は監督でもなく、選手でもない。 He is neither a manager nor a player.\\n\\n(And as expected, in speech you would replace なく with なくて.)\\n\\nBy extension, the same rule applied to adjectives (you\\'ve already seen the\\npositive form):\\n\\n> この本は面白くもなく、つまらなくもない。 This book is neither interesting nor boring.

In isolation, this noun form is read as “tori.”\\n\\nBoth _Katate Tori_ and _Katate Dori_ are compound words made of _katate_ (片手;\\none hand) and _tori_. However, in Japanese, the first consonant of the second\\ncomponent of a compound word is often changed as k→g, s→z, t→d and h→b. This\\nphenomenon is called [rendaku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendaku) (連濁).\\nNote that I said “often,” not “always.” If rendaku occurs in your case, the\\ncompound word becomes _Katate Dori_. If not, it becomes _Katate Tori_.\\n\\nThere are some patterns when rendaku tends to occur and when it cannot occur\\nas is explained in Wikipedia, but there is no absolute rule that explains\\neverything. In the case of _katate_ \\\\+ _tori_ , it is certainly possible to\\nhave rendaku here, so _Katate Dori_ is a possible form. But this does not mean\\nthat rendaku must occur, so the form _Katate Tori_ is also possible.\\n\\nOften only one form survives and the other form dies out, in which case we can\\nsay that one form is correct and the other is incorrect in the modern\\nlanguage. In some cases, the version without rendaku and the version with\\nrendaku both survive but mean different things. For example, both _yamakawa_\\nand _yamagawa_ are compound words made of _yama_ (山; mountain) and _kawa_ (川;\\nriver), but _yamakawa_ means mountains and rivers whereas _yamagawa_ means a\\nriver in a mountain.\\n\\nBut in your case, it seems that both forms are used in the same way judging\\nfrom several webpages in English I found by web search. (I checked the pages\\nin English because it is difficult to search this in Japanese, because when\\nwritten in Japanese, both become 片手取り, as Andrew stated in his answer.)

Polite forms are\\nexpected to be used in formal situations, with most strangers, with peers you\\nare not intimate enough with and with superiors. Polite forms don\\'t form as\\ncoherent system as Sonkeigo and Kenjōgo do, but it\\'s also quite simpler, since\\nyou just have to remember that some grammatical forms or expressions are\\npolite, some are intimate and some are downright rude. We actually have the\\nsame thing in English: \"Could you hand me the salt, please?\" is quite more\\npolite than \"Hey, give me the salt!\"\\n\\n**Keigo** (敬語) itself, refers to the proper usage of two distinct forms of\\nlanguage: _sonkeigo_ (尊敬語) and _kenjōgo_ 謙譲語.\\n\\n**Sonkeigo** (尊敬語) means _honorific language_. This category encompasses all\\nwords (mostly verbs) prefixes, suffixes, expressions and grammatical forms\\nthat are considered to convey honor to the person or group they refer to.\\nThese words are often used when referring to superiors, clients, and in some\\nsituations to anyone that is part of the recipient\\'s inside group. Knowing in\\nwhich situations one should use sonkeigo (and kenjōgo) is an entirely\\ndifferent question, and it\\'s highly related to Japanese social and cultural\\nnorms, so it\\'s natural that it seems very baffling to us foreigners in the\\nbeginning. :)\\n\\n**Kenjōgo** (謙譲語) means _humble_ or _deferential language_. This category\\nencompasses all words (mostly verbs) prefixes, suffixes, expressions and\\ngrammatical forms that are considered to convey humility about the person or\\ngroup they refer to. These words are mostly used when speaking to someone in\\nsonkeigo and referring to yourself or to people who are in your inside group.\\n\\nVery often, certain sonkeigo or kenjōgo bits are used without the entire\\nconversation getting to stick to keigo rules. For instance, when two parents\\nspeaking about their respective sons, they may call each other\\'s son 息子さん and\\ntheir own son just 息子. You may call that sonkeigo and kenjōgo if you like\\n(though some people may argue it isn\\'t), but in the end the two parents might\\nspeak entirely casually. Another place you\\'d often find bits of sonkeigo and\\nkenjōgo \"out of place\" is set phrases such as ありがとうございます (kenjōgo) or\\nおはようございます (sonkeigo).\\n\\n### Don\\'t politeness and keigo always come together?\\n\\nNow, when keigo is used consistently, it\\'s most often used with teineigo\\n(since when you\\'re using keigo you\\'d generally want to be polite), but it\\ndoesn\\'t necessarily have to. As far as I can see, the main problem with using\\nkeigo without teineigo, isn\\'t that it would sound rude, but rather that it\\nwould just sound too archaic.\\n\\nThe reason for that is that keigo was indeed used regularly without modern\\nteineigo suffixes (of the ます and です family) during the Edo period, and you can\\nstill hear such language when watching historical films or TV dramas (時代劇\\nJidaigeki). But since most people now identify these forms with the Edo\\nperiod, they\\'d seem more archaic than they\\'d seem impolite. It\\'s kinda like\\n_thou_ , which originally was just an intimate version of the polite _you_ ,\\nwould seem to modern English speakers more archaic than impolite.\\n\\n', parent_id='882'),\n",

Consider it a proof of sorts.\\n:)\\n\\nThe Classical Japanese of early Heian period had a form called ～たり form, which\\nwas used for several jobs that today are fulfilled by the ～た, ～て and (the\\nmodern) ～たり forms. This form was attached to the _renyōkei_ (連用形), which is\\nthe verb stem that ends in I for Godan verbs (this is the stem to which you\\nattach the ～ます or ～たい endings).\\n\\nThe ~たり form was later shortened to ~た in speech and became the past form we\\nall known and love today, but before that, it was actually used to build a few\\nother forms. Now, the ～たり form was actually creating a new verb (just like\\nadding the potential, passive or causative endings to a verb today create a\\nnew verb), so it had it\\'s own stem to which other endings could be attached.\\nOne of them was the old hypothetical ending ～ば (actually, the famous particle\\nは which became ば after the verb). ば was attached to the _mizenkei_ (未然形),\\nwhich is the verb stem that ends in A for Godan verbs (this is the stem to\\nwhich you attach the ～ない ending used for negation). Since, the mizenkei of ～たり\\nwas naturally ～たら, the whole thing together was ～たらば, which at sometime became\\na very common complex form for conditionals. e.g. (I invented this up myself,\\nso it\\'s probably not quite authentic):\\n\\n> 書きたらば、死ぬ。 If you write, you die.\\n\\nIn modern Japanese, the classical ～ば form became the modern conditional ～ば\\nwhich is now attached to the E stem (已然形 _izenkei_ ), and is much better known\\nas the _-eba_ conditional ending. But what happened to the complex ～たらば～ form?\\nIt was shortened to ~たら, but also started using the different base that ～て and\\n～た forms (the later also a shortened form of ～たり) were using. In Ichidan verbs\\n(such as 見る or 食べる) this is still the same as good old _renyōkei_ , but in\\ngodan verb, a few changes occured:\\n\\n  * wakar **i** \\\\+ tara -> waka **r** \\\\+ tara -> waka **t** \\\\+ **t** ara -> waka **tt** ara\\n  * kak **i** \\\\+ tara -> ka **i** \\\\+ tara -> ka **it** ara\\n  * oyog **i** \\\\+ tara -> oyo **i** \\\\+ (voice) + tara -> oyo **i** \\\\+ **d** ara -> oyo **id** ara\\n  * mat **i** \\\\+ tara -> ma **t** \\\\+ **t** ara -> ma **tt** ara\\n\\nThere are more, but that\\'s the gist of it.\\n\\n', parent_id='889'),\n",

At least not something that\\nwill help you learn which is which. Some 形容動詞 take な, some take の, and some\\ntake both. How did that happen? That\\'s quite simple.\\n\\nAll 形容動詞 are in fact a special class of nouns. In academic English material,\\nthey are often called \"adjectival nouns\" or even \"descriptive nouns\", to\\nemphasize the fact that they\\'re nouns. So how do you use a noun to describe\\nanother noun? Since Classical Japanese we had two main methods of doing that:\\n\\n  1. Using the the copula (ADJであるNOUN)\\n  2. Using the genitive relation particle (ADJのNOUN)\\n\\nIn Classical Japanese, the copula was なり, and for genitive relation we also\\nhad が besides の, but it probably worked more or less the same. In the modern\\nlanguage, the copula なり went out of use and was replaced by だ in all forms\\nexcept for the positive present form, where な (which comes from なり) remains in\\nuse.\\n\\nThe inconsistency is mainly there, in the positive present form, since in\\nother forms (past or negative), the copula is used always. That\\'s because you\\njust cannot use の in other forms, since it\\'s not copula and therefore does not\\nconjugate, so you have to replace it with forms of the modern copula だ. な, on\\nthe other hand, can be said to be a copula, but it conjugates like だ in all\\nother forms, so in these forms all adjectival nouns behave the same.\\n\\nBut still, why is the choice of の, な or both in the present-positive form so\\ninconsistent? That\\'s just how languages tend to work, chaotically. When you\\nhave two possible ways of forming an adjective (with a copula and with a\\ngenitive particle), people use both, and both forms come into what linguists\\ncall \\'a competition\\'. There are several possible resolutions to a competition,\\nsuch as one of the forms dying in favor of the other, or each form grabbing a\\ndifferent meaning. In this case, we have a [complementary\\ndistribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_distribution), where\\nsome adjectival nouns settled take な, some settled for の, and for a good\\nmeasure of irregularity some settled for both.\\n\\n', parent_id='920'),\n",

If able, I highly recommend reading the original\\npost, however.\\n\\n**Usage Context/Literary Differences**\\n\\nWhen studying Japanese, 「〜について／〜についての」is studied before 「〜に関する／関して」. That is\\nto say, 「〜について」is often used as a basic phrase in conversation.\\n\\nIn the case of foreign language study, when you translate into your own\\nlanguage and the words come out the same the difference can be difficult to\\nunderstand. However, there is the following difference. 「〜について」→ Expression\\nused often in conversation. 「〜に関して」→ Expression often used in written\\nlanguage.\\n\\n**About The Differences In Usage**\\n\\n1) The meaning of「○○について～する」\\n\\n![nitsuite](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzNgq.png)\\n\\nWith verbs like 「話す」and 「考える」, for the reason of stating the topic or theme\\nabout which you intend to speak or think about first, 「について話す／考える」is used. In\\nother words, if you were to say 「自分の夢について話す」, it would be because you are\\ngoing to talk about things like 1) What you want to be, 2) Why you want to be\\nthat, 3) How you\\'re going to become what you want to be.\\n\\n2) The meaning of 「○○に関して〜する」\\n\\nThe meaning of 「関する」is \"to be related\", \"to have a connection\".

This is very incomplete, but let me post it as\\nan answer because I hope that it explains a small part of the question.\\n\\nAs a background, as explained in the answers to [this\\nquestion](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/402/is-it-ok-to-use-\\ninstead-of), いただく is to receive and くださる is to give. So the grammatical\\nsubject of the first part of the sentence\\n\\n> 文章を訂正していただきましてありがとうございます。\\n\\nis the speaker (who “received” the favor), while the grammatical subject of\\nthe first part of the sentence\\n\\n> 文章を訂正してくださいましてありがとうございます。\\n\\nis the listener (who “gave” the favor). Both describe the same fact and the\\nonly difference is perspective. I do not think that there is any difference in\\nmeaning between the two sentences in each pair, and we can use both sentences\\nno matter whether the favor was offered voluntarily or as a result of asking.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNow why do we hear ～いただきまして more often than ～くださいまして? I do not have a\\nreference at hand, but as I wrote in the answer to the other question, one of\\nthe ways to express the politeness in Japanese is by avoiding using the person\\nto be respected as the grammatical subject. This is probably why we hear\\n～いただきましてありがとうございます more often than ～くださいましてありがとうございます.\\n\\nBecause ～くださいまして is more direct in the sense that it uses the listener as a\\nsubject, there might be cases where the sentence using ～くださいまして has a nuance\\nof the favor offered voluntarily, but I cannot get a grip on this. Even if\\nthis nuance exists, it is understandable that ～いただきまして is used more often\\nsimply because ～いただきまして is more polite.\\n\\nI have no idea which of ご来店いただいたお客様 and ご来店くださったお客様 is used more often, and if\\nthe latter is more common, I do not know the reason for that.\\n\\n', parent_id='957'),\n",

And when they fail (since\\n**Japanese has no real adjectives at all** ), the naïve learner or teacher\\n(which unfortunately includes most textbook writers, who are not\\nlinguistically trained) will try to force their familiar concepts on Japanese.\\n\\n## What is an adjective?\\n\\nBefore we get to discussing what the \"adjectives\" in Japanese really are, we\\nfirst have to define and understand the concept of adjective - otherwise it\\nwould be quite meaningless talking about them. I\\'ll have to concede here that\\ndifferent linguistic schools have different ideas of adjectives, so the idea I\\nrepresent here represents structural linguistics and especially the ideas of\\nsome of my own teachers. Some other schools (e.g. many functionalists) have\\nnot all too different ideas, but others, generative linguists in particular,\\nmay not agree.\\n\\nAn adjective is most simply a [word\\nclass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_class) that is used specifically to\\nqualify and describe nouns by being in\\n[agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_%28linguistics%29) (i.e.\\nmatching [gender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender),\\n[number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_number) and/or\\n[case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case)) with them. A classical\\nexample would be the following Latin pairs, where as the noun changes, the\\nadjective changes as well (note that word order is not important, and\\nadjectives don\\'t even have to be adjacent to their nouns):\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n             Abacus (masculine)       Terra (feminine)\\n    Singular novus abacus             nova terra          New abacus/land\\n    Plural   novi abaci               novae terrae        New abacuses/lands\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\nYou\\'ve probably noticed that English adjectives do not really match this\\npattern, since they show neither gender nor number nor case (they did show all\\nof that in Old English, but not anymore). And indeed, the English adjectives\\nare not quite adjectives in the classical sense, and the line is actually\\nquite blurred between nouns and adjectives in English (Is \\'winter\\' in \"\\n_winter_ clothes\" an adjective or a noun? And what about \\'Hollywood\\' in \"a\\ntypical _Hollywood_ ending\"?). In fact, English adjectives resemble the na-\\nadjectives of Japanese more than Latin (and French, German, Spanish and\\nHebrew) adjectives.\\n\\n## Japanese counterparts of adjectives\\n\\nJapanese has three (or more accurately two and a half) word classes whose most\\nmembers translate to adjectives in English and other European languages, and\\ntherefore they are all usually called \"adjectives\" in textbooks. These classes\\nare\\n\\n### 形容詞: Descriptive verbs\\n\\nDescriptive verbs are also called _stative verbs_ (verbs of state) or\\n_adjectival verbs_ by linguists, but most of us know these guys as _i-\\nadjectives_ or even _true adjectives_. Descriptive verbs are really just\\nverbs, although they miss some verbal forms that are available to other verbs.\\nIn essence, descriptive verbs are just verbs that come before the noun and\\nform a [relative clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_clause).\\nThere\\'s really no difference in syntax between 踊る蝶 (the butterfly who is\\ndancing) to 白い蝶 (the butterfly who is white).\\n\\n### 形容動詞: Descriptive nouns\\n\\nDescriptive nouns are also called _adjectival nouns_ by linguists, but most of\\nus know them as _na-adjectives_ or _quasi-adjectives_. Despite their name,\\nthey are no less adjectives than the \"true adjectives\", and [some of\\nthem](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/920/why-is-it-that-some-\\naccepts-after-it-while-some-only-accepts-after-it) can actually be connected\\nto nouns by using の rather than な. Historically, descriptive nouns were either\\nnouns followed by the genitive の or nouns followed by な, which is the\\nattributive (before-noun) form of the copula なり. So a の-adjective like `普通の男`\\nstarted out as basically just saying \"a man of ordinary\", and `静かな場所` (which\\nin classical Japanese meant: `静かである場所`) started out as saying \"a place which\\nis silent\".\\n\\nIt\\'s instructive to note that descriptive nouns actually take a completely\\nnormal copula instead of な when past or negative forms are used (e.g.\\n`普通だった男`, `静かじゃない場所`), so these adjectives actually still use a copula to this\\nvery day, but it\\'s most common form is replaced by the special な or の\\n(depending on the adjective).\\n\\n### 連体詞: Attributives\\n\\nThis class includes a rather small number of words that attach directly to the\\nnoun without a special copula and have no verb-like conjugation (like 形容詞).\\nThis includes words such as ある (some), いわゆる (so-called), 同じ (the same), たいした\\n(great), この・その・あの, 大きな and 小さな. In fact, it\\'s not really a real consistent\\nclass, but just a mish-mash of several frozen forms of words that used to be\\nverbs (ある, いわゆる、たいした), descriptive nouns (大きな and 小さな), pronouns that merged\\nwith the particle の (この・その・あの) and the more special case of 同じ. There\\'s\\nnothing much to unite them, and this class is not productive (i.e. creating a\\nnew word in this class is very rare, and not at all trivial).\\n\\n## What\\'s the state in other languages?\\n\\nWell, the situation in Classical and Old Japanese was very much as it is\\ntoday, except for descriptive nouns not using a special copula, but the\\nregular copula instead. The conjugation of descriptive verbs was very\\ndifferent from today, but normal verbs also had a different conjugation.\\n\\nI know Okinawan has at least descriptive verbs that are directly related to\\nthe descriptive verbs in Classical Japanese: e.g. `takasi` ( _tall_ ) from Old\\nJapanese becomes `takasan`. I guess it should also have a class of descriptive\\nnouns, since they tend to be more productive than verbs, but I really don\\'t\\nknow much about it.\\n\\nAs for Korean, it definitely resembles Japanese here. Descriptive verbs are\\nconjugated like normal verbs but have some differences with them. Descriptive\\nnouns have to be followed by the verb 하다 (hada - _to do_ ) instead of the\\ncopula, as we do in Japanese, but other than that they are very much alike.\\n\\n', parent_id='1008'),\n",

StoryBoard上でSegueを定義しておく\\n\\nStoryBoard上で以下の設定を行います。\\n\\n  1. 「TableViewController」と「遷移先ViewController」をStoryBoard上に設置\\n  2. 「TableViewController」の`Custom Class`を`SourceTableViewController`に設定\\n  3. 「 遷移先Controller」の`Custom Class`を`DestinationViewController`に設定\\n  4. 「TableViewController」から「遷移先ViewController」へ`Segue`を張り、`Segue`の`identifier`を`toDestinationViewController`に設定\\n\\n## Step2. DestinationViewController.hにlinkをpropertyとして定義しておく\\n\\nCellをタップしたときの遷移先のDestinationViewControllerはlinkを値として受け取る必要があるので\\n外部から受け取れるようにheaderファイルに`link`をproeprtyとして定義しておきます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n    # DestinationViewController.h( Cellをタップした時に移動する遷移先のControllerクラス)\\n    @interface DestinationViewController : UIViewController\\n    \\n    # 外部から受け取りたいパラメータを定義(今回は文字列のlink情報)\\n    @property NSString *link;\\n    \\n    @end\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n## Step3. SourceTableViewController.mで選択Cellの情報をSegueを経由して遷移先に渡す処理を実装\\n\\nまずCellが選択された際に遷移が実行されるように`didSelectRowAtIndexPath`の中で`performSegueWithIdentifier`の呼び出しを実装します。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n    # SourceTableViewController.m( JSONを表示するTalebViewControllerのクラス )\\n    - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\\n    {\\n        # \"toDestinationViewController\"はStoryBoardで設定したSegueのIdentifier\\n        [self performSegueWithIdentifier:@\"toDestinationViewController\" sender:nil];\\n    }\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n次にSegueを経由して遷移先のに選択されたCellに表示されている情報をパラメータとして渡す処理を実装します。\\n\\n`prepareForSegue`が遷移前に呼ばれ、そこでSegueに関する情報を処理できます。\\n\\nなので、`prepareForSegue`で選択されたCellのlink情報を、遷移先のDestinationViewControllerに渡す処理を実装することで、やりたいことが実現できるはずです。\\n\\n具体的な実装例は以下のようになります。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n    # SourceTableViewController.m\\n    - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {\\n        # 選択されたCellのIndexPathを取得します\\n        NSIndexPath *selectedIndexPath = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];\\n    \\n        # indexPathから、選択されたItemを取得します\\n        NSDictionary *selectedItem     = self.items[ selectedIndexPath.row ];\\n    \\n        # segueが持っている遷移先のViewControllerのインスタンスを取り出します.\\n        DestinationViewController *destinationViewController =     segue.destinationViewController;\\n    \\n        # DestinationViewControllerのインスタンスのプロパティのlinkに選択されたItemのlinkを代入\\n        destinationViewController.link = [selectedItem objectForKey:@\"link\"];\\n    }\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n##  Step5. DestinationViewController.mで受け取った値を利用する\\n\\n今までの実装で、DestinationViewControllerが表示された際にはインスタンスはlink値を持ってるはずです。\\nviewDidLoad等の中で値が入っていることを確認して利用してください。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n    # DestinationViewController.m\\n    - (void)viewDidLoad {\\n        [super viewDidLoad];\\n        # 選択されたCellのlink値が_linkに入っているはず\\n        NSLog(@\"link:%@\",_link);\\n        # _linkを使った処理を実装\\n    }\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n以上の処理で、Segueを利用してUITableViewControllerで選択されたCellの情報を遷移先のControllerに渡すことができると思います。\\n\\n', parent_id='287'),\n",

// => [10, 10, 10]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\nこれならばシンプルですし、RubyJSと比べても見劣りしないと思います。\\n\\n**Underscore.jsの場合**\\n\\nUnderscoreでは、デフォルトで`_`（アンダースコア）という名前のグローバルオブジェクトが定義されています。その`_`に実装されているmap関数を使って、配列にコールバック関数を関連付けます。上で述べたJSの場合と同様に、以下のどちらかの方法で数値化できます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     _.map([\\'10\\', \\'10\\', \\'10\\'],parseInt.bind(null, 10));\\u3000 // => [10, 10, 10]\\n     _.map([\\'10\\', \\'10\\', \\'10\\'],Number);\\u3000 // => [10, 10, 10]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n**RubyJSの場合**\\n\\nRubyJSでは、`_a`という名前のグローバルオブジェクトに配列関連のメソッドが定義されています。 以下のどちらの書き方もできます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     _a.map([\\'10\\', \\'10\\', \\'10\\'], parseInt); // => [10, 10, 10]\\n     _a.map([\\'10\\', \\'10\\', \\'10\\'], Number); // => [10, 10, 10]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n確かにシンプルにコーディングできます。\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n## 比較2. 配列のソート\\n\\nもうひとつの比較を見てみます。ここでは、配列を`sort()`するコードが載っています。\\n\\n>\\n[code]\\n\\n>     // JS\\n>     [1, 8, 15].sort()     // => [1, 15, 8]\\n>     // underscore\\n>     _.sortBy([1, 8, 15])  // => [1, 15, 8]\\n>     // RubyJS\\n>     _a.sort([1, 8, 15])   // => [1, 8, 15]\\n>  \\n[/code]\\n\\nこのコードが言わんとしていることは、「JSやunderscoreでは配列中の文字列を単純にソートきないけど、RubyJSなら簡単だよ」ということだと思います。更に解りやすくするために、数値を書き換えて以下のようにして考えます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     // JS\\n     [33,4,1111,222].sort()     // =>  [1111,222,33,4]\\n     // underscore\\n     _.sortBy([33,4,1111,222])  // => [1111,222,33,4]\\n     // RubyJS\\n     _a.sort([33,4,1111,222])   // =>\\u3000[4, 33, 222, 1111]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n**純粋なJavascriptの場合**\\n\\nJavascriptの`Array.sort()` を使って以下のようにすると、アルファベット順にソートされた結果が返ります。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     [33,4,1111,222].sort();     // => [1111,222,33,4]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\nアルファベットではなく数値として比較したい場合には、以下のように書けます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     [33,4,1111,222].sort(function(a,b){ return a - b;})); // => [4, 33, 222, 1111]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n**Underscore.jsの場合**\\n\\nUnderscoreでは、`sortBy()`を使って以下のようにできます。\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     _.sortBy([33,4,1111,222], function(num){ return num; });// => [4, 33, 222, 1111]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n**RubyJSの場合**\\n\\n[code]\\n\\n     _a.sort([33,4,1111,222])// => [4, 33, 222, 1111]\\n    \\n[/code]\\n\\n確かにシンプルです。\\n\\n以上です。Rubyライクなコーディングが好きな方にはよいかもしれません。\\n\\n上述のコードを[JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/naokiota/24ceLxv7/1/)に置きました。\\n\\n', parent_id='179'),\n",
